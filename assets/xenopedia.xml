    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">You've probably already noticed we're being invaded, Commander, so I won't state the obvious. The situation is bleak; none of the major powers are able to defend their own airspace, let alone protect the rest of the planet.&#10;&#10;It seems things are up to us. My team stand ready to help - there may only be a handful of us, but some of the finest minds on the planet are at work in your laboratories (this organisation offers a certain freedom from intrusion that appeals to those of intelligence). The key to beating our enemies is to understand them; we are keen to study any extraterrestrial equipment you can recover from the battlefield. In the meantime, we have been gathering intelligence on the size and composition of the alien fleet orbiting our planet - mostly images and data obtained from orbital satellites or ground-based observatories. Given the depressingly disjointed response from the rest of the planet, this is probably the most in-depth study of the invasion to date.&#10;&#10;We have conclusively identified over three thousand separate UFOs in orbit around the planet, with several times that amount of additional probable signals. The fleet is comprised of craft of various sizes: the UFOs already sighted entering our atmosphere represent the smallest orbital signatures detected, while the largest signals identified appear to be enormous warships with dimensions rivalling that of modern aircraft carriers.&#10;&#10;A glimmer of hope remains - the alien craft seem poorly suited to atmospheric flight. Our interceptors may enjoy some early success against the superior extraterrestrial vessels simply due to better adaptation to the combat environment. This may also explain the appearance of only relatively small craft in the skies above our planet - our scientists theorise that the aliens will have to modify their craft to enter our atmosphere. The larger the craft, the longer this will take. If they are correct, the largest craft will only appear in the later stages of the invasion. Perhaps this will afford humanity (read: us) enough time to organise a more  effective defence.&#10;&#10;I have two recommendations: that we consider supplementing our existing F-17 Condor aircraft with a heavier interceptor capable of carrying more powerful weapons, and that we investigate some form of battlefield support vehicle to aid our soldiers when securing crashed alien craft. Both proposals are already on your desk.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">The MiG-32 &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is a derivation of the experimental Soviet MiG-31 &quot;Foxhound&quot; interceptor. Originally designed to intercept supersonic NATO bombers, the Foxhound has the immense speed and climb rate we will need to catch fast UFOs and the additional firepower required to deal with heavier alien craft.&#10;&#10;Naturally, we will be modifying the Foxhound to make it more effective against extraterrestrial craft (hence the updated &quot;Foxtrot&quot; designation). The airframe can be reinforced with the same titanium / magnesium alloy that has made our Condors more resistant to alien weapons, whilst the fuel tanks will be enlarged to increase the range of the interceptor. We will also have to replace some of the avionics; the requirements for intercepting human aircraft and extraterrestrial vessels are rather different. In all, this takes the production time for a Foxtrot up to roughly 40 man days.&#10;&#10;Once successfully converted, the Foxtrot will be a formidable tool in our battle against the aliens. It has two missile hardpoints under its wings, each of which can carry either a light missile such as the Sidewinder, or a heavy air-to-air &quot;torpedo&quot; (such as the Avalanche) that can inflict devastating damage on anything too slow to avoid them. Unfortunately, the Foxtrot does not possess a cannon slot nor the agility to safely perform the Evasive Roll combat maneuver.  It will be defenceless once it has fired both its missiles, easy pickings for any alien craft nimble enough to avoid them - so accompany it with more capable dogfighters if the target has an escort. &#10;&#10;You can begin fabrication of the Foxtrot in our workshops immediately. I would avoid spending too long down there, though - I feel like my IQ drops a dozen points every time I visit our resident ogres.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">Alien technology is founded on a variety of exotic materials, every one of which possesses remarkable properties. We have identified materials with tensile strength and heat resistance an order of magnitude greater than anything previous known, as well as those with more exotic properties such as room-temperature superconductivity.&#10;&#10;Almost all of them are ultra-advanced ceramics with a chemical structure as alien as the extraterrestrials themselves. Though we have yet to encounter any unknown fundamental element in these materials, we have little idea how they generate their extraordinary powers or how they could be manufactured. It is the difference between coal and diamond - fundamentally the same stuff, but radically different in practice. &#10;&#10;Given their exceptional heat resistance, the most obvious military application of these alloys would be in personal battlefield armour. Unfortunately, they are so effective at dissipating heat that nothing in our laboratory can generate enough to melt them - making fabrication of a plate of armour (or anything else) little more than a pipe dream. Though still effectively useless, we are harvesting these alloys from recovered artefacts where possible. The aliens must have the means to shape these materials, so further study of their technology may allow us to do the same.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s77"><Data ss:Type="String">The Plasma Pistol is an alien sidearm that is approximately eight inches long and roughly a kilogram in weight. Though it bears some resemblance to a human firearm, it does not fire a bullet but rather a searing bolt of superheated plasma.&#10;&#10;It is a powerful weapon, easily capable of killing an unarmoured man in a single shot. However, our tests suggest the compact size of the weapon renders it fairly inefficient: the plasma bolt loses cohesion and starts to dissipate almost immediately. It is thus most dangerous at short ranges, where a single shot has a good chance of killing one of our soldiers outright. As that range increases, the projectile steadily becomes less accurate and damaging. The lesson here should be clear: fight units equipped with this weapon from as far away as possible. &#10;&#10;Though it would make a fine addition to our arsenal, this weapon has clearly been designed for alien troops. Anatomical differences between our species make it difficult for a human to wield effectively, so any soldier attempting to use this weapon on the battlefield will suffer severe accuracy penalties when doing so. Sadly, we are also nowhere near understanding or replicating the technology contained within the weapon (recovering more advanced alien weapons may help in that regard). All is not lost, however - running more tests on this weapon should allow us to develop battlefield infantry armour better suited to protecting our men from extraterrestrial energy weapons.</Data></Cell>

Though we have no definite answers, there are hints as to the origins of the aliens.&#10;&#10;There are strong similarities in the physiology of all biological alien units encountered so far: for example, all are humanoid. All also possess both a circulatory system and central nervous system, albeit with some variation in function. This allows for the possibility of a common planetary origin; the huge variety of life on our own planet clearly illustrates that an array of vastly different creatures can evolve simultaneously on a single planet. This was our initial assumption, largely due to the shared habitat inside the alien UFOs - an atmosphere containing perhaps 5-6% oxygen, rather than the 21% of ours. The aliens respire via oxygen in much the same manner as humans do, using a common vector to distribute it around the body: a semi-synthetic protein that mimics the role of human haemoglobin, but much more effectively (and giving alien blood a distinctive purple tint).&#10;&#10;However, the fundamental organic chemistry is so dramatically different between alien species that a common origin cannot be possible. The reason these species can share a common habitat is not evolution, but rather extensive genetic engineering. This oxygen-carrying protein bears no resemblance to any other part of any of the corpses studied - in other words, it appears an external force has engineered these creatures to be capable of breathing the same air that they do. The identity of this external force and the reasoning behind this decision remain obscure, at least for now.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, we are turning this research to practical use. My team have constructed holding tanks in the laboratories which can be used to confine captured alien units in a low-oxygen environment (if exposed to our atmosphere for long enough, alien units will eventually succumb to oxygen toxicity), allowing us to study them more closely.</Data></Cell>

It is a translucent yellow material that resembles amber in appearance and forms the core of the alien power source recently recovered (the rest of the device ultimately proving inconsequential). &#10;&#10;Detailed analysis of Alenium's molecular structure reveals an incredibly dense atomic arrangement, allowing the material to store energy in quantities previously thought impossible. Despite this, the material remains inert and has a half-life of nearly a trillion years. It can be cracked if enough mechanical force is applied, but this will not cause an energy discharge. This can be explained by the exceptionally stable arrangement of atomic chains, which also contain a clue as to how to unlock the energy trapped within: each chain contains regular &quot;weak&quot; bonds that can be broken with precise application of energy. By specifically targeting and breaking these weak bonds with a laser, one can easily generate a controlled energy release of virtually any size.&#10;&#10;This leads me to believe that Alenium is no more than an incredibly advanced alien battery. The molecular structure is not one that would occur naturally nor contain any inherent energy of its own, but it makes a perfect method of storing the output from a far greater power source. As we have no way of recharging Alenium and will almost certainly be using it to power any new technology we develop, we should make an effort to recover as much as possible from UFOs and alien ground forces.</Data></Cell>

I have developed a method of shaping captured alien alloys, allowing us to incorporate them into our designs for the first time. This is largely a result of tapping the vast reserves of energy locked away inside our stores of Alenium; though the foundry processes are a little more complex than simply blasting the materials with our upgraded laboratory lasers until they melt, for the sake of brevity I will leave the explanation at that.&#10;&#10;Needless to say, this is a discovery of enormous significance. We can vastly improve the efficiency of our existing technology with alien materials, but they also open the door to ideas that seemed impossible only a few weeks ago. The frontiers of science have moved more in the past few months than they did in the previous century; some of these alloys have properties that barely even exist in theoretical science. I must admit that my team are struggling with the pace of advance - we are sometimes as much limited by our scientific education as we are enlightened by it.&#10;&#10;The proposal for developing improved battlefield infantry armour with these materials may therefore seem a little underwhelming, but it marks only the start of what we can achieve. I would not be surprised if we were building whole vehicles or entire aircraft out of them soon.  In the meantime, if you see any off-duty scientists strolling around the base, please remind them that: (a) they should be in bed, and that (b) research materials should stay within the laboratory at all times. The number of unauthorised &quot;upgrades&quot; appearing across the base is matched only by the amount of yawning in my labs. </Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">Studying the innards of the alien Plasma Pistol and Plasma Rifle has given us a basic understanding of the science behind extraterrestrial directed energy weapons. We remain some distance from replicating plasma-based weapons ourselves, even in a laboratory setting, but our work raises the tantalising possibility of battlefield laser weapons.&#10;&#10;A brief explanation of the generation of a plasma bolt is as follows: firstly, the weapon draws power from an Alenium cell and uses it to fuel a powerful array of particle accelerators. Secondly, these accelerators superheat a large number of atoms into a state of ionised gas within the heat-proofed 'chamber' of the weapon. Thirdly, two helical spirals of electromagnets in the barrel of the weapon pulse simultaneously, drawing the plasma from the chamber and spinning it into a bolt while accelerating it to muzzle velocity. Finally, a graviton emitter in the muzzle of the weapon launches a graviton particle into the plasma bolt as it exits the barrel. &#10;&#10;This graviton particle is incredibly important - in laboratory conditions, it has been observed to possess a strong gravitational pull that prevents the bolt from dissipating into a useless cloud of hot gas. The science behind this process is unclear (it is the first time we have observed a graviton), but it probably explains the large difference in range between the alien Plasma Pistol and Plasma Rifle.  Sadly, we have no idea of how to replicate this gravitational field ourselves - and without access to an effective anti-gravity emitter, the useful range of our most powerful lab-based plasma generator is only a few inches. One would hope that study of the more advanced alien weapons may shed more light on the process.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, our efforts would be better focused on the development of battlefield laser technology. We have learned enough from studying the power distribution and cooling systems of the alien weapons that I believe I can replicate them in our own designs, making building man-portable laser weapons from these new alien materials a theoretical possibility.</Data></Cell>

Any laser powerful enough to be a viable combat weapon would need a battery the size of a truck - the word &quot;impractical&quot; being an understatement.&#10;&#10;The arrival of alien technology has changed all of this. The enormous energy content of an Alenium crystal allows a battery no larger than a standard ammunition magazine to generate up to a dozen laser beams, each capable of burning through an inch of steel. Superconducting ceramics can be used to cool the weapon, storing the waste heat from each shot and dissipating slowly enough to avoid injury (provided one is careful where they place their hands). This eliminates the need for bulky refrigeration units, reducing the size and weight of the weapons significantly.  &#10;&#10;In order to minimise adjustment time for our troops, our laser weapons have been designed to operate like conventional firearms and have similar range and accuracy to their predecessors. There are some notable differences, most obviously the improved damage thermal shock weapons inflict upon their targets. Less favourably, a laser weapon will have roughly half the ammunition capacity of a ballistic weapon. In order to streamline this process, we have designed a single standardised battery for all of our laser weapons. The design is not complex; a cylindrical steel jacket that contains an Alenium crystal and locks into the weapon with a simple twist. These power cells are trivial to manufacture compared to the weapons themselves, so are available in effectively unlimited quantities.&#10;&#10;Be aware that manufacturing these weapons consumes a large amount of alien alloys and is both expensive and time consuming - but I still believe they represent a good investment despite this. At the very least, some new toys may raise morale amongst your men.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">One of your engineers recently presented me with an idea for a rapid-fire laser weapon. Though it is (predictably) expressed crudely, the fundamental science appears sound.&#10;&#10;The ideal approach would be to generate a continuous beam of energy that can be &quot;swept&quot; across the battlefield, but even alien superconductors are not capable of dissipating the amount of heat generated by sustained continuous fire. The proposed solution borrows heavily from the Autocannon mounted on our interceptors - multiple rotating barrels. Instead of using a rotating barrel arrangement to facilitate high-speed loading of ammunition, it can be used to vastly reduce the amount of heat continual fire will generate in each individual barrel. We have successfully tested two three-barrel prototype weapons in our laboratories.&#10;&#10;The Scatter Laser is a rapid-fire infantry weapon designed to replace the ballistic Machinegun. It inflicts increased damage and suppression, at the cost of reduced ammunition capacity. Unfortunately, it still suffers &quot;recoil&quot; (albeit in this case caused by the spinning of the heavy cooling arrays rather than the recoil of the projectiles) and therefore will require a strong soldier to achieve full accuracy with this weapon.&#10;&#10;The Gatling Laser is scaled up to fit the cannon hardpoint on our interceptors, using a triangular arrangement of three powerful lasers that collectively inflict much greater damage than the conventional Autocannon. The increased size and weight of the weapon allows us to use mostly conventional materials in the construction of the weapon and its power cell, paradoxically making them far easier and faster to manufacture than their smaller cousins. As such, we have already upgraded our existing Autocannons to the new design - the only difference you should see is increased combat effectiveness.</Data></Cell>

Rather than sustaining a uniform level of heat, the target suffers repeated &quot;pulses&quot; of intense heat that causes rapid fracturing of the surface material. As the surface material breaks apart and disintegrates this effect becomes even more pronounced, giving the Pulse Laser excellent armour penetration compared to standard lasers. &#10;&#10;We have developed a variant of the weapon small enough to mount on our Hunter scout car that is available for immediate use in the Garage. This is fitted with a battery that holds enough power for 8 shots and should substantially boost the combat effectiveness of the vehicle. We have also used the Pulse Laser to upgrade our base defense batteries. Pulling power directly from the base reactors, they should greatly improve the chances of destroying an attacking extraterrestrial craft before it can unload ground forces. The retrofit is already well underway and should be complete by the time you read this; any future defence batteries we construct will also incorporate laser technology into their design (at least until we develop something better).</Data></Cell>

Collectively, this offers dramatically improved resistance to injury. The centimetre-thick breastplate is capable of stopping a .50cal round at point blank range; it is the equivalent of walking around with three inches of steel strapped to your chest. Both the plating and the undersuit have also been impregnated with a dense network of ultrafine superconductor filaments, which absorb the heat from an energy projectile and dissipate it across the full surface of the armour, giving the soldier underneath a much improved chance of surviving the impact.&#10;&#10;None of this appears to have dramatically improved the mood of your soldiers.

The Heavy Plasma has a stubbier, wide barrel that contains a plasma generation chamber twice the normal size but an electromagnetic coil only half the usual length. This makes the plasma projectile significantly more energetic (and more penetrative) than the equivalent from the Plasma Rifle, but also less stable. It begins to break apart almost immediately, giving it approximately half the operational range of an alien Plasma Rifle.&#10;&#10;However, it is a worringly effective weapon.

There appears to be three main possible avenues of attack, all of which are equally effective against humans as they are against aliens: &#10;&#10;The first is simple concussive force applied to the victim's brain or nervous system, either via physical impact or the shockwave from an explosion. This method is both crude and unreliable (particularly against tougher alien species such as Sebillians), but you may find it occurs unexpectedly on the battlefield. The second is oxygen starvation, where higher brain functions shut down due to lack of oxygen. This can happen incidentally via smoke inhalation, or can be induced via a &quot;stun gas&quot; that temporarily binds with the victim's blood and prevents it from carrying oxygen around the body, generating a powerful disabling effect without ultimately being fatal if sufficient amounts are inhaled. &#10;&#10;The final method of incapacitation is an electrical current delivered at a sufficiently high voltage, which will utterly disrupt the nervous system of the victim and render them unconscious. This is extremely effective, but highly dangerous - an electrical discharge of the required voltage can only be delivered with a melee weapon.

This chemical agent is highly toxic to both alien and human units and even short-term exposure may cause debilitating injury or death. It has been developed to attack the two important biological pathways identified in our work on Alien Biology to be shared by all extraterrestrial species - their circulatory and nervous systems. The agent contains numerous compounds that interfere with one or both of these, divisible into nerve agents or blood agents.&#10;&#10;Nerve agents attack the extraterrestrial nervous system by interfering with the operation of nerve synapses, stifling the breakdown of the neurotransmitter that causes muscles to contract. Exposure leaves the victim unable to relax its muscles, initially causing convulsions and then asphyxiation as the respiratory system goes into spasm shuts down. Blood agents are little better; once absorbed into the blood they will attack the systems of oxygen transmission. The more pleasant compounds will simply bind permanently with the oxygen-carrying proteins in alien blood, sealing them off so they can no longer carry oxygen. Others will destroy the blood cells entirely, or attack the walls of blood vessels to cause major internal bleeding. This also results in respiratory failure.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, these toxins are almost as effective on humans as they are on extraterrestrials, so any soldiers or civilians who inhale the chemical gas will rapidly be overcome. However, I draw your attention to the fact that these compounds are all absorbed via exposed skin or through inhalation. Advanced armour (whether human or extraterrestrial) that incorporates a rebreather or covers a large area of skin will dramatically reduce the damage that the toxins will inflict on the wearer.&#10;&#10;Mass-production of these toxins has not proved difficult even with only conventional human technology, so Toxin Grenades have been made available to our troops in unlimited quantities.</Data></Cell>

This organic computing power continuously analyses the power demand in the network and channels energy to where it is needed most, either storing or releasing charge from dozens of integrated capacitors when necessary. The end result is a biological smart-grid that can reduce power consumption by almost fifty percent; the aliens do not just have access to vastly larger amounts of energy than us, they also use it more efficiently too.&#10;&#10;Our crude reproductions of these organic circuits are nowhere near as efficient as the alien equivalents, but will still be very useful when building complex machines such as vehicles or aircraft.

It is considerably tougher than its predecessor and is armed with a powerful integrated Pulse Laser (which can be upgraded in future if we develop better weapons).&#10;&#10;The chassis of the Scimitar is squat but sturdy, giving the vehicle a low profile and providing ample space for the vehicle's powerplant - the ER-4 Alenium Impulsion reactor, a downscaled version of the Corsair's ER-3 reactor. The turret weapon draws power directly from the reactor, eliminating the need for any ammunition storage areas in the turret. Instead, this space houses a complex array of cameras / sensors. Semi-intelligent alien electronics inside the vehicle handle many of the simpler tasks usually performed by the driver, allowing us to situate the vehicle pilot safely within a control facility back at base. I personally fitted signal boosters to our dropships that allow a driver to control the vehicle as if he were inside it, despite potentially being thousands of miles away. Unsurprisingly, our tests so far suggest I have done an excellent job setting everything up. &#10;&#10;Removal of the driver has two chief advantages - the first is that the removal of the crew compartment and the ventilation systems leaves space for additional armour, naturally itself also constructed from alien materials. Given that vehicles are large targets on the battlefield, this added durability is extremely valuable. Secondly, the fact that one of your units is a lump of inert metal (albeit an expensive one) rather than a living and breathing human being may make battlefield decisions a little easier for you.</Data></Cell>

This was largely accidental - my team destroyed alien electrical systems on several occasions by running an overly large current through them, while your engineers helpfully demonstrated that they were also vulnerable to being dropped on the floor. Though I was not particularly amused at the time, the knowledge gained eventually proved useful.&#10;&#10;I present you with the Electroshock Grenade. It generates a powerful electromagnetic discharge on detonation, inflicting major EMP damage on any mechanical unit caught in the blast and stun damage on biological ones (as there is no explosive component in the device the terrain will remain completely unaffected). The stunning effect of the grenade is not quite as powerful as that generated by a stun baton, but this is offset by the greater range. This will be of great relief to your men: I have noted the soldiers assigned to capture duty (&quot;shock-jocks&quot;) appear to have significantly lower morale than the others.&#10;&#10;The Electroshock Grenade is also very useful for destroying robotic enemy units. The EMP pulse completely bypasses the target's armour and overloads the electronic systems underneath. The actual damage inflicted is only average at best, but could still prove very useful against well-protected extraterrestrial drones and robots that are difficult to damage through conventional means.</Data></Cell>

It is fitted with an integrated jump unit, a device that allows the wearer to move vertically on the battlefield. Refinement of the armour plate has decreased weight, slightly reducing protection but letting the soldier carry more into battle. &#10;&#10;The jump unit is a rather substantial device worn in a back harness. It consists of a miniaturised Alenium reactor connected to a pair of thrusters that sit above the wearer's shoulders, paired with various gyroscopic flight control systems and sensors. Though the jump unit is not powerful enough for prolonged flight, the user is able to hover for short periods if necessary. Even those who are not trained as pilots should find it easy enough to use in combat - input from the wearer is recorded via touchpads in the gloves, allowing them to steer their intended flight path (sadly also preventing them from using weapons while airborne). A complex array of vectored thrust ports copied from the alien directional thruster design provide fine control and auto-stabilisation when in flight. &#10;&#10;Clearly, the ability to &quot;jump&quot; atop buildings or leap impassable terrain has utility on the battlefield - particularly for your scouts and marksmen. Soldiers regularly exposed to enemy fire will likely still need the added protection of the Wolf, however.</Data></Cell>

We believe it is best thought of as the alien equivalent of a bazooka or rocket-propelled grenade, firing a single powerful bolt of plasma that has great range and will inflict major damage on anything caught in the blast radius.&#10;&#10;It is vastly superior to its conventional counterparts. The most obvious advantage is the increased damage it inflicts: at short range it can penetrate at least 15 inches of solid steel (precise measurements were difficult as we ran out of steel before the projectile ran out of power). In basic terms, it is enough to destroy virtually any conventional vehicle in the world in a single shot. Also important is the ammunition capacity of the weapon - it takes even a skilled operator up to ten seconds to reload a traditional anti-tank weapon after every shot, while the alien Plasma Cannon can draw four shots from its battery before it must be changed. The weapon also suffers minimal recoil and has no back-blast, making it easier to handle and safer for adjacent friendly units.&#10;&#10;Thankfully, alien materials are far more resistant against the penetrative effect of these projectiles than conventional materials. We believe the vaporised metal forms a shell around the projectile when it strikes steel, doing much of the penetrating work for it. However, the higher melting point of alien alloys prevents this from occurring and instead the projectile must rely on raw energy to inflict damage. Our more advanced technology gives us some protection against this weapon - though the Wolf and Buzzard are not strong enough to protect a soldier from a direct hit, the Wolf in particular should help our troops survive being caught in the blast. I have already warned your men about the fearsome power of this weapon; one hopes it will encourage them to get out of the way of the projectiles. </Data></Cell>

It is fitted with a complex holographic sighting array and produces a focused bolt of plasma that travels extremely quickly and can maintain stability over great range, suggesting it is the alien equivalent of a sniper rifle.&#10;&#10;The weapon has remarkable internal similarities to the Heavy Plasma, possessing the same lengthened generation chamber that significantly amplifies the energy content of the resulting bolt. The main difference lies with the helical spiral of electromagnets housed in the barrel of the weapon: long and thin, rather than short and compact. This results in a narrow and stretched bolt of plasma that can carve through the air with less resistance (and destabilisation) than normal, and then focus a great deal of energy into a narrower impact point to give more penetrative power. &#10;&#10;This fearsome penetrative power is actually somewhat of a mixed blessing. The plasma bolts will punch through almost any concievable type of armour, but will also punch right through the soldier underneath. While I doubt having a tunnel half an inch wide burned straight through your body is a particularly pleasant experience, it is unlikely to be fatal unless it strikes the brain or another vital organ. This weapon therefore presents an interesting conundrum: it is very accurate even at long range and will bypass any protective equipment the target may be wearing, but it also fires slowly and is unlikely to kill a soldier outright.</Data></Cell>

I have intercepted the dispatch from our esteemed Chief Scientist and replaced his self-indulgent prattle with something useful.&#10;&#10;There are two structures of tactical importance in an underground alien base. The first is the base power core, which should be easily identifiable by their blue glow. They provide power to the entire base, but most crucially they drive the life support systems that maintain the atmosphere at the correct level of oxygenation to allow the aliens to survive. If this core is destroyed, the base will exhaust backup power within the hour and the crew will begin to suffer from oxygen toxicity. It is almost certain that the aliens will self-destruct the base to avoid it falling into enemy hands (though whether they will evacuate the crew first is debatable). If your goal is simply to destroy the base, then you only need destroy this core and then withdraw your men from the facility.&#10;&#10;If you are interested in capturing the base and recovering the technology contained within, you will need to assault the other important structure - the command room. This is the nerve centre of the alien base, containing the alien commander and his guards. They are the most fearsome units in the base, but will not move from their location if the facility falls under attack. I believe their primary duty is to protect the base commander, presumably an important figure in the alien hierarchy and potentially with access to sensitive information. If this is the case, death would be preferable to his capture (from the alien point of view, at least). Assaulting the command room and clearing the base of all extraterrestrials is much more dangerous than simply destroying the power cores and withdrawing, but the rewards are correspondingly higher. The ultimate choice of strategy lies with you, Commander, but hopefully you are now aware of all of the options.</Data></Cell>

Our new biological computers and instruments mean that my team are no longer entirely reliant on our own (ample) brainpower and have been able to fully automate several formerly time-consuming tasks, giving us more time to think. I have also had our upgraded laboratories soundproofed, allowing the brilliant minds among us to work without being disturbed by the less brilliant.&#10;&#10;There have also been a number of less obvious improvements to our base - e.g. the refit of base kitchens with laser-based ovens capable of cooking food in mere seconds, or the upgraded recreational areas with holographic entertainment consoles. Both of these have proved immensely popular, but unfortunately the replacement of the showers in the Living Quarters with (vastly-superior) alien gel sacs proved less popular. Events culminated in an incident with some of your soldiers, leading to the upgrade being postponed for now...but I hope you will discipline your men accordingly.&#10;&#10;Finally, we have developed an internal network that links all of our systems together, whether the same facility or not.

However in recent times we have come close enough that we can bridge the gap using the favoured technique of the intellectually deficient: imitation. This has allowed us to build a functioning copy of the graviton emitter that had stymied our progress up to this point. &#10;&#10;Given our detailed understanding of the plasma accelerator that converts the energy into a plasma bolt and the electromagnet spiral that shapes the bolt, we were able to use trial and error until we stumbled onto a working configuration of the three components. Small adjustments to the relative scale and distance between these three components allows us to generate plasma bolts with subtly different properties, thus producing different weapons. These plasma weapons are a straightforward upgrade for our existing laser weapons, inflicting heavier damage whilst maintaining similar range and accuracy. In most other respects, they behave much like their predecessors.&#10;&#10;Finally, I discovered recently that the Nobel Prize panel does not disqualify submissions if the scientific advances in question have been stolen from extraterrestrials rather than humans.

It seems the recovered Directional Thruster array explains how this is possible.&#10;&#10;The device consists of a central &quot;brain&quot; and a series of rotatable thrusters mounted outside of the ship's hull. These thrusters were clearly originally designed for maneuvering in a vacuum, but during atmospheric flight take on the combined role of wings, stabilisers and elevators. An outer &quot;shell&quot; of tiny flaps, each able to provide tiny amounts of vectored thrust, allows an immense amount of control over the output of each individual thruster. Collectively, a network of a dozen or more of these thrusters gives a craft the ability to perform some fairly remarkable acrobatics. Though this system is hardly energy efficient compared to conventional flight control systems, alien craft generate enough power that this is not a problem.  &#10;&#10;The &quot;brain&quot; is an oval structure roughly the size of a car engine. It contains a crowded arrangement of sensors and a dense mass of biological electronics that we believe automatically stabilises the flight of the UFO based on the incoming sensor data. Unfortunately, this biological brain would be too complex to replicate - but it may be possible to substitute it. Automated control systems for spacecraft have been around for almost twenty years, so I imagine with a little time my team would be able to adapt and improve the existing designs to create something capable of controlling a few of these thrusters. We may not be able to create a system as elegant as the extraterrestrial one, but even a basic solution could dramatically improve the performance of our interceptors and dropships. </Data></Cell>

It uses a pair of tilting TF-19 turbofan engines to cruise through the air at supersonic speeds and then perform a vertical landing on arrival at the target site. These monstrous turbines are themselves driven by two sizeable ER-12 Alenium reactors, providing enough power to keep even a fully-loaded craft airborne for days - in fact, the range limitation of the craft is due to pilot fatigue rather than fuel capacity.&#10;&#10;However, the most important result of these new engines is a greater carrying capacity than the CH-48 Charlie. The Shrike can carry up to ten soldiers (rather than eight) inside its armoured troop compartment, which has large ramps at both the front and the rear to allow safer disembarkation in a hazardous landing zone.

The Reactor is actually more efficient at harvesting the energy already being emitted - it seems that the Power Source represents the simplest method of utilising Alenium, easy to construct but not particularly space-efficient. The alien Reactor is used in situations where extra power is needed, but scaling the Power Source up by a factor of ten would not be viable. The utility becomes obvious when you remember that drag increases exponentially with size and observe that enemy capital ships are getting larger &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; faster.&#10;&#10;The Reactor is able to capture all this additional energy by harnessing the power of gamma rays. The breakdown of chemical bonds in Alenium seems to release a burst of gamma radiation in addition to the heat that fuels our current reactors.  This gamma burst is incredibly energetic but also extremely focused (an unfocused burst of this magnitude would be extremely dangerous) and angled towards six narrow cylindrical tubes of a superdense alien alloy that radiate out from the core like the spokes on a bicycle wheel. This material absorbs the gamma radiation and is rapidly heated by the bombardment of high-energy particles, generating an immense amount of extra useful energy in the form of heat.

Laboratory tests suggest that it is almost fifty percent more effective at absorbing damage than standard alien armour plate of similar size and weight. Given the fundamental composition of the two types of plating is not dramatically different, the extra strength must have arisen from the production process (the same as separates a diamond from a lump of coal).&#10;&#10;The atomic structure of the alloy yields the explanation. Like terrestrial metals, most alien alloys have a crystalline form when solid - a compact and orderly arrangement of atoms. However, the various alloys used in the hardened plate are amorphous rather than crystalline. Amorphous materials instead have an irregular and disorderly atom arrangement that prevents the formation of microscopic lines of weakness that can exist in crystalline structures, giving the hardened plate enhanced heat and impact resistance.&#10;&#10;This phenomenon is hardly unknown to science - exactly the same thing occurs when hot steel is quenched in cold water. However, applying the process to alien materials is far more difficult: preventing the formation of a crystalline structure in some alloys can require cooling of up to a hundred million degrees per second. Prohibitive at the start of the war, perhaps, but my intellect (admittedly paired with alien materials) was able to overcome the obstacles entirely. The cooling process consumes large amounts of Alenium, but we can now produce these hardened materials on a sufficiently large scale to incorporate them into our own designs.</Data></Cell>

The backplate unit contains both the SA-16 personal Alenium reactor (which generates enough power to keep the suit operating at full capacity virtually indefinitely) and rebreather apparatus that renders the wearer completely immune to environmental toxins. Conventional measures of protection are almost meaningless by this point, but a Predator could wade through molten lava or withstand a small nuclear blast with little more than superficial damage.&#10;&#10;The suit uses powerful servomotors that give it functional strength two or three times greater than the average human. This allows the wearer to operate heavy automatic weapons as if they were normal weapons, able to fire on the move and their accuracy unaffected by recoil. Nor is the wearer slowed by the weight of their equipment; even the heaviest load is of little consequence to a Predator. Nor, indeed, are walls - the sheer bulk of the suit means it can charge straight through many of them with no ill-effects whatsoever.&#10;&#10;However, the design is limited by its view cone and weapon selection. The reduced spatial awareness caused by the enclosed helmet is compounded by the poor peripheral vision granted by the cameras, effectively giving the wearer a permanent case of tunnel vision. Additionally, the massive armoured gauntlets of the Predator are simply too large and clumsy to use much of our equipment. Heavy weapons can be modified easily enough, but the battlesuit cannot use lighter weapons or other equipment like grenades, stun weapons and protective shields. Much like an actual tank, a Predator will require infantry support if it is to be fully effective.</Data></Cell>

It is a naked singularity, what I believe is the final state of a black hole - a final explosion that releases all of the energy accumulated by the black hole across its lifetime. The extraterrestrials must have found a method of &quot;capturing&quot; black holes and artificially inducing this explosive state. Once this has been done, the particle field is used to &quot;freeze&quot; the singularity mid-explosion.&#10;&#10;This forms an elegant closed system. The particle field captures the vast quantities of energy emitted by the singularity, siphoning off a small amount to maintain the field and feeding the excess back into the singularity (which promptly re-emits it). The enormous amount of power flowing endlessly through the loop can then be tapped as required by anything connected to the Singularity Core. As each singularity contains a finite supply of energy, the energy flowing through the circuit will eventually fall to zero - at which point both the particle field and singularity collapse and disappear entirely.&#10;&#10;The Singularity Core represents the solution to every power consumption issue we have ever had. Alenium reactors can only be miniaturised so far, but the Singularity Core provides almost limitless amounts of power and the containment field can be made small enough to fit inside virtually anything we can dream up.

The helmet also features a unique camera system that allows the wearer 360-degree vision.&#10;&#10;The Sentinel contains thousands of tiny sensors that work to detect and augment the wearer's movement, making it operate more like a second skin than a half-tonne armoured suit.  It is capable of the same dexterity and range of motion as an unarmoured soldier, whilst also providing amplified strength and excellent protection. The helmet contains a full rebreather system (rendering the wearer immune to smoke and gas effects) and a variety of sensors and cameras linked directly to the helmet visor, giving the wearer unparalleled awareness of the battlefield around them. The jump unit does away with the miniaturised jet turbines of the Buzzard and utilises alien antigravity technology instead, resulting in a much more compact device that also contains the suit reactor.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that this level of precision engineering would simply not be possible if the Sentinel were armoured as heavily as the Predator. The more primitive design still excels at soaking up damage and remains our best option for assault work, but the Sentinel is far more versatile in combat. A mixture of the two designs would be a powerful combination; taken together they represent the final word in the development of battlefield protection.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">As improving our plasma technology to the point where it surpassed that of the aliens would be virtually impossible, new ideas were needed. They arrived in the form of old ideas. MAG weapons are electromagnetic coilguns that combine the remarkable properties of alien materials with our existing knowledge of ballistic weapons.&#10;&#10;The idea behind a Gauss gun / coilgun has been around for over a century and consists of a series of electromagnets firing sequentially, accelerating a projectile along the barrel of the weapon to deadly speeds. The parallels with alien plasma weapons should be obvious - but while the plasma technology uses the electromagnetic acceleration as a means to an end, a coilgun uses it as a means in itself. The technology can be adapted from existing plasma weapon designs and has some significant advantage, e.g. an energy projectile does mostly thermal damage and can be partially absorbed / reflected / dissipated by a number of factors, atmospheric conditions included. A spot of rain will not offer much protection against a metal pellet travelling at five times the speed of sound.&#10;&#10;MAG weapon prototypes have been built in Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Precision arrangements, each one small enough to be carried by an infantryman but still capable of delivering a pellet of alien alloy at hypersonic speed. They are almost certainly the most powerful terrestrial infantry weapons that will ever exist - pushing muzzle velocity any higher would raise air resistance highly enough to explosively ignite the air behind the projectile (likely killing the soldier firing the weapon). It seems we are now limited by the composition of our atmosphere rather than by our technology. </Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">The X-120 &quot;Fury&quot; interceptor is the ultimate weapon in the battle for our skies. It is an unmanned craft with virtually unlimited range that can fly so high and so fast that no UFO has a hope of outrunning it, let alone intercepting it. It can travel at Mach 8 (some 10,000 kilometers per hour), allowing it to reach any point in the world in under two hours. It carries a single super-heavy Singularity Torpedo on each mission.&#10;&#10;The Fury was influenced by the allegedly secret SR-71 &quot;Blackbird&quot;, which is almost invulnerable to conventional technology due to its impressive speed and service ceiling (not that our organisation would have much trouble dealing with them). The design has been evolved and enhanced, not least by removing the pilot and the equipment required to keep him alive. An autonomous flight computer tracks sensor data against mission parameters, adjusting its behaviour to ensure the mission is completed as quickly and safely as possible. The engines are a three-stage turbojet / ramjet / scramjet design where each stage speed the craft to the point at which the following stage can kick in.&#10;&#10;The scramjets engage at Mach 4 and each produce 75,000 lbs. of thrust, rapidly accelerating the Fury to Mach 8. At these speeds air resistance heats the surface of the craft to 4,000 degrees Celsius, ordinarily impossible to sustain without a spacecraft-style ablative coating that requires replacement after every flight. However, hardened alien alloys have proved more than capable of resisting that sort of temperature indefinitely - allowing the Fury to travel so quickly that it is entirely immune to damage from enemy UFOs. Unfortunately, as weapons also need to be designed specifically for hypersonic launch, the speed of the craft also limits the weapons that can be carried to just one: the super-heavy Singularity Torpedo.&#10;&#10;Unsurprisingly, the power requirements for these monstrous engines and the highly advanced flight computer are enormous. A Singularity Core is the only viable power source, so each Fury built will require us to capture one from an extraterrestrial capital ship.</Data></Cell>

It produces a perfectly spherical release of energy that will instantly reduce anything within five kilometers to its constituent atoms (do not expect to recover anything from alien craft destroyed by this weapon). As it has been designed specifically for hypersonic launch, it may only be carried by our X-120 Fury interceptor. &#10;&#10;The destructive power of the weapon is drawn from the practically limitless energy held within a Singularity Core. The looping particle field that stabilises the singularity can be replicated and used as a method of storage, capturing energy when connected to the Core and releasing it when the loop is later broken. A charged loop can thus be used as the warhead on a torpedo, containing so much energy that it will utterly annihilate anything caught in the blast radius. It has actually been necessary to develop a method of using part of the discharge to generate a larger secondary field that artificially limits the size of the explosion - without it, there would be a small but statistically significant chance of the detonation destroying our entire planet.&#10;&#10;The rest of the torpedo is relatively straightforward design. The main propulsion unit employs a scramjet, which allows roughly thirty seconds of flight at speeds reaching Mach 15 (almost 20,000 km/h). This not only allows it to be launched by a Fury travelling at hypersonic speed, but actually necessitates it - a scramjet can only generate thrust when it is sucking in air travelling at Mach 4 or higher, a speed that our other interceptors cannot reach.</Data></Cell>

These characteristics make it just as adept at dealing with small alien interceptors as it is attacking large capital ships.&#10;&#10;Our greatest advances in performance came from setting aside the old conventions of aircraft design. The fuselage of the Marauder contains a network of powerful integrated thrusters that provide lift and propulsion, with the stubby forward-swept wings mostly being employed for fine maneuvering. While these wings contribute heavily to the overall agility of the interceptor, it is actually entirely capable of flying without them. The same can be said for the tail / vertical stabilisers, where the traditional vertical arrangement has also been replaced with a more unusual forked design.&#10;&#10;With few aerodynamic concerns, we have been able to focus our attention on combat performance instead. The armour plated &quot;shell&quot; of the craft is fabricated entirely from hardened alien materials and is nearly four inches thick in some areas, making it more akin to a flying tank than a normal interceptor. The extra engine thrust allows it to carry both a cannon and heavy torpedoes, making it a much more rounded combatant than any of its predecessors. The resulting interceptor is squat, ugly and capable of destroying almost anything it encounters (much like our engineers).</Data></Cell>

It has greater mobility and can move much faster than its predecessor, but uses hardened alloys to derive increased protection from thinner armour plating. It is inherently more stable as a gun platform than a tracked / wheeled vehicle and has also been fitted with upgraded targeting computers, giving it excellent accuracy at all ranges. Though barely half the size of a modern battle tank, one of these skimmers could easily defeat an entire armoured platoon single-handedly.&#10;&#10;The skimming effect is provided by the anti-gravity generator, which reduces the effective weight of the tank to a couple of hundred kilos when active (without it, the Hyperion is a six-ton lump of immobile metal). Vectored thrust is then provided by a small jet turbine, producing the skim effect and allowing the precision maneuvers required to operate the vehicle in confined spaces. The integrated AR-6 reactor requires a large amount of Alenium to construct, but will provide enough power to maintain the anti-gravity field for at least a year. That should be more than enough time to settle this war, one way or another.</Data></Cell>

This Anti-Gravity Generator reveals the brilliant solution: create a device that reduces the weight of the ship. &#10;&#10;A simple explanation - weight is the force acting on an object due to gravity. This device creates a localised field that negates any gravitational pull acting on objects within the field, leaving them otherwise unaffected (and their mass unchanged) but reducing their weight enormously. This allows a UFO to fly using only a fraction of the thrust that would otherwise be needed / could plausibly be generated - indeed, any capital ship that suffered a field malfunction in our atmosphere would meet a rather abrupt end.&#10;&#10;The function of the device revolves around gravitons, which are the force carriers for gravity in much the same way that photons are the force carriers for electromagnetic radiation (such as light). This device emits a stream of anti-gravitons that pair up with gravitons in the nearby area, annihilating one another in a process that reduces the gravitation force acting on the area. This device can annihilate over ninety percent of the nearby gravitons, leading to a corresponding ninety percent drop in the weight of anything inside the field. It should be easy enough to replicate the technology and use it in our own designs; I have no doubt that it will prove to be a very useful discovery.</Data></Cell>

Their long-range transmissions are compressed to a remarkable degree - only a few fleeting nanoseconds of signal can carry all the data the aliens need.&#10;&#10;The short duration of these transmissions makes it extremely difficult to capture any fleet-level alien communications, but the sheer quantity of radio receivers on our planet means that a few examples have been recorded purely by chance. There are literally thousands of intelligence operatives across the planet who are working to crack the encryption codes, but the extraterrestrials are using quantum-level cryptology. It is highly unlikely that humanity could crack the codes in the lifetime of our galaxy, let alone that of a human being (so it is open to debate whether our attempts to do so should be considered inspirational or grossly stupid).&#10;&#10;Anyway, a far more effective solution would be to capture a device capable of decrypting the signal. The decryption devices aboard UFOs captured to date have proved completely inert, apparently requiring an alien user. However, one of the artefacts your men recovered from the captured alien base appears to be a communications array capable of sending transmissions - so once it was set up to transmit in our laboratories, we could reverse-engineer the encryption methods in a matter of hours. We can use this knowledge to design a base structure that will decode the transmissions sent by alien vessels, giving us additional information on their composition and intent.&#10;&#10;Incidentally, the transmission that the rest of the world is so desperately working to decode is the autopsy report of an unfortunate freshwater salmon abducted and dissected by the alien forces.

The yield of the warheads is actually rather small compared to what we could achieve (the Fusion Missile is approximately 0.5 kilotons and the Torpedo 2 kilotons), but we have not designed these weapons for nuclear-style indiscriminate destruction. They borrow from the design of the HEAT warheads on our old Avalanche missiles, focusing the explosion into a jet of high-velocity particles designed to pierce armoured UFO hulls. &#10; &#10;To generate this effect, both weapons are fitted with a dense tungsten cone that sits just in front of the warhead. When detonation occurs, the cone is immediately vaporised and the resulting spear of tungsten particles are propelled forwards at hypersonic speeds. This bombardment is capable of causing significant damage by itself, but it also fractures the heat-resistant outermost layer of the armour and leaves the UFO more vulnerable to the immense heat generated by the fusion reaction occurring in the warhead. An extremely effective design, if I say so myself.</Data></Cell>

Once combined with a pair of powerful turbines and the A-23 Alenium Pulse reactor, we have a craft that is capable of carrying a full twelve soldiers (or equivalent) into battle. Considering the sheer weight of our more advanced vehicles and personal armour, this is a remarkable achievement.  The fact that the Valkyrie can cruise at nearly 2,000 pm/h while doing so is simply a bonus.&#10;&#10;Launch tubes based on the electromagnetic launch tracks found in Carrier UFOs allow Xenonaut units to be dropped anywhere in the landing area (though not the entire battlefield) at the start of the battle. The drop pods themselves may not look much, but are actually remarkable pieces of innovation. Once launched, each will generate an invisible plasma field that protects the user and slices a path through the air at several times the speed of sound. Once the pod drops to within a few hundred metres of the ground, landing rockets fire and slow the descent to a safe speed. The plasma field dissipates the moment the pod touches the ground and allows disembarkation.&#10;&#10;Your soldiers may find the experience of being fired towards a combat zone at nearly a thousand miles an hour a little discomfiting, but I'm afraid they will have to get used to it.

It proved more effective to use a portion of the energy in the Alenium to power a small plasma generator that forms a superheated globe of energy at the front of the warhead as it detonates. This acts like a plasma &quot;drill&quot; and melts a path through the armour, the thrust from the rocket engines providing the momentum needed for penetration. &#10;&#10;The remaining energy in the warhead is then used to generate an explosion in the same manner as in a conventional Alenium warhead. The energy drained by the previous stage means this explosion is smaller than before, but the greater penetration of the warhead means that it will actually inflict 40-50% more damage.

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">The Alien Fusion Reactor is a large circular construction used to power the larger extraterrestrial capital ships.  It consists of a central Alenium core and a toroidal outer ring that produces a powerful magnetic field to contain the fusion reaction and the 2.2 billion Celsius temperatures that accompany it. &#10;&#10;The reactor is not actually fuelled directly by Alenium. The Alenium is used to power the energy fields needed to smash together deuterium (a hydrogen isotope) nuclei and generate fusion, a process that itself emits a vast amount of energy - the Alenium just acts as a &quot;starter motor&quot; for the process. As deuterium is freely available and not required in large quantities, this allows a weight of Alenium to release vastly more energy than it itself contains. The limiting factor is the intricacy of the design - the Fusion Reactor is much more advanced and would take far longer to build than a pure-Alenium reactor. It is therefore ideal for larger alien vessels, which have vast power demands but are sufficiently important to warrant use of such a valuable device.&#10;&#10;We have built a miniaturised fusion reactor in our laboratory using techniques learned from studying the alien design. Shrinking the reactor has caused some loss of efficiency, but relative to its size (no larger than a car engine) it generates at least twenty times more power than anything previously built - it actually puts out almost as much energy as our base reactor. In any case, the ability to obtain vastly increased amounts of power from our existing energy stores is likely to lead to further technological advance.</Data></Cell>

It is a gateway to another dimension of the multiverse (&quot;hyperspace&quot;), which is of equivalent size but has rather different set of laws to our own.&#10;&#10;The Hyperdrive is a large cylinder roughly 5 metres long and 1.5 metres wide. A plasma-filled tube runs the full length of the device, suspended within four rotating electromagnetic rings. The power requirements of the device mean we have only been able to test it on microscopic objects (sadly none of your engineers were willing to donate their brain), but I believe I have discovered how it works. The electromagnets and the plasma tube together generate a magnetic field around the target, which acts as a &quot;tunnel&quot; between two linked points in hyperspace. In effect, the target is occupying two different locations at once - both of which are in another dimension.&#10;&#10;Once this hyperspace &quot;tunnel&quot; has been created, the device disengages. The target is promptly returned to our own dimension, but cannot simultaneously exist in two places at once so is forced to occupy only one. Crucially, it appears the device somehow ensures that the destination point is always chosen over the origin point. Objects can therefore be transported almost unlimited distances with ease, although increased distance between the destination and origin does lead to increased power consumption.&#10;&#10;I do not know how this hyperspace gateway is opened, nor explain the dramatically different laws of physics at work there - that work can be done once the war is over. All we need to know is that this device works, and that we must find a way to disable it.</Data></Cell>

The intricacies of MAG technology are extremely complex and dramatically different from those of ballistic weapons, but there are still basic principles that can be carried between the two.&#10;&#10;The rotary barrel arrangement is one, having served us well even for our rapid-fire energy weapons. We have adapted it for one final use: the MAGSTORM, a devastating weapon capable of annihilating a target in a hail of hypersonic projectiles. It consists of four rotating barrels, each of which has an electromagnetic spiral that is wound twice as tightly as on a standard MAG weapon. This could be used to impart more force on a projectile, but instead the weapon is set up so that each bullet uses only half of the coil. This allows each barrel to accelerate two bullets simultaneously, giving eight times the normal fire rate with no loss of stopping power. &#10;&#10;This technology is equally effective when using small-calibre infantry ammunition or large-calibre aircraft munitions. It represents the ultimate in rapid-fire weaponry; I'm sure your men will be keen to get their hands on them.</Data></Cell>

It is also an excellent defence battery weapon, the only ground weapon we have that is capable of breaching the thick armour of an alien capital ship.&#10;&#10;The MAG Railgun is a railgun rather than a coilgun. Rather than using a coil of magnets to accelerate the projectile, it instead uses a parallel pair of oppositely-charged electromagnetic rails. These are linked by the projectile itself, which effectively completes the electrical circuit between the two rails. The resulting magnetic force pushes the projectile along the rails and launches it from the end of the gun barrel at high speed. The railgun design is more complex in practice than the coilgun, but is more efficient and can generate much greater projectile velocities.&#10;&#10;Our prototype is extremely powerful and can impart enough kinetic energy into a projectile to launch it clean into orbit...although the air resistance means there would not be a great deal of it left afterwards. Nevertheless, this makes the Railgun a rather handy battlefield tool. It is capable of annihilating most targets with a single shot, whilst also inflicting heavy explosive damage on anything nearby. We have already fitted enlarged versions of these weapons on our existing defence batteries, making them significantly more effective. In a sense, it is a pity that Earth possesses an atmosphere: if it did not burn up our projectiles as they travelled through it, we could simply blast the alien UFOs out of orbit. </Data></Cell>

The &quot;scout car&quot; designation is instructive; the Hunter is not a battle tank. Any vehicle light enough to be carried inside a helicopter will have relatively flimsy armour and the Hunter is no exception to this. Nevertheless, it is far quicker to replace a few damaged armour plates after a mission than it is to nurse a wounded soldier back to health, making this vehicle an extremely effective way to scout the battlefield in the hands of a careful commander.&#10;&#10;The Hunter is equipped with dual .30cal machineguns, which are powerful but inaccurate. They are better suited to suppressing our foes than slaying them, making the Hunter a useful infantry support vehicle. If you would like to upgrade its firepower, your engineers believe they could refit the turret with powerful explosive rockets instead - however, these are hardly likely to leave much behind for my team to study.&#10;&#10;The Hunter is available for construction in our workshop.

However, testing a modified combat vest with heat-resistant rather than impact-resistant ceramic plates showed impressive results. The ceramics were able to dissipate enough of the heat to give the wearer a reasonable chance of survival, though they are still likely to suffer injuries in the process.&#10;&#10;While it provides an obvious boost to survivability, this armour is heavy and will limit the other equipment (such as ammunition or secondary weapons) a soldier can carry into battle. Armour also degrades rapidly under fire and will not withstand repeated hits, nor provide the wearer guaranteed protection - e.g. it hardly matters what armour a soldier is wearing if he is shot in the face.

This low-grade Alenium only contains enough power to run an extraterrestrial device for a few minutes, whereas fresh Alenium can do so for hours at a time. However, it turns out there is another use for this relatively abundant low-grade Alenium: explosives.&#10;&#10;The amount of energy held in depleted Alenium is usually still appreciably higher than is contained in the equivalent weight of TNT. My team has therefore been able to produce improved designs for the high-explosive rockets and grenades issues to our soldiers, replacing the explosives with an Alenium charge that is up to 50% more powerful than conventional munitions. Given the ample availability of the constituent parts, these can be manufactured and issued to our soldiers in effectively unlimited numbers.  Your men seem impressed; they spent so long testing the new devices that the firing range required structural repairs.&#10;&#10;The principle behind these devices is simple: the &quot;explosive&quot; is a block of Alenium that dumps all of its energy into the surrounding air when triggered. The warhead on the rocket is sufficiently large that this will generate a sizeable explosion, but the grenade also employs a steel casing that fragments into a deadly cloud of metal shards on detonation. However, be aware that these weapons will inflict as much damage on extraterrestrial equipment as on the aliens themselves - aliens killed with explosives are unlikely to leave a corpse behind, let alone recoverable items.</Data></Cell>

Nonetheless, we have been successful - and as the new warheads can be fitted to our existing rocket engines, we have already upgraded your interceptors accordingly.&#10;&#10;The required armour penetration is achieved by fitting a small laser emitter to the top of the Alenium block. This fires in a pre-determined pattern, which can be changed to allow us to shape and focus the explosive charge in any direction that we choose. With no time to conduct extensive studies on the effectiveness of different charge patterns, we instead just ensured that the energy from the blast is focused forwards rather than wastefully radiating in all directions. Crude, perhaps, but certainly functional.&#10;&#10;The Alenium Missile is a direct replacement for the Sidewinder light air-to-air missile, whilst the Alenium Torpedo replaces the heavy Avalanche torpedo. The latter is a powerful weapon well suited to dealing with lumbering alien craft without the speed or agility to avoid it, the former a faster missile that inflicts less damage but is more likely to hit alien lighter vessels. In both cases the upgrades are just straightforward warhead swaps, so this should not dictate any major change in aerial tactics beyond making our engagements a little easier.</Data></Cell>

The technology of the Alien Reactor itself may not be directly applicable to our existing Alenium explosives, but the principles it operates on are.&#10;&#10;While low-grade Alenium is a reasonably destructive explosive in its own right, this is a rather crude way of using the energy. Using it to generate superheated plasma is a more efficient way of damaging a target than just dumping the energy from the explosive into the air around it (which has a high thermal resistance). As such, we have developed a miniaturised plasma generator that can be used to rapidly convert all of the warhead energy into an expanding sphere of plasma. This pushes the air around the point of detonation aside, rather than transmitting energy through it; losing less energy to thermal resistance increases the destructive energy of the explosive.&#10;&#10;This has allowed us to design a Plasma Grenade and Plasma Rocket to replace the existing Alenium explosives and a Plasma Charge to replace our existing C4 explosives. These Plasma explosives are also available to our men in effectively unlimited quantities, so we have withdrawn the obsolete weapons and replaced them accordingly (in order to minimise disruption to combat operations, the only difference between them is increased damage).</Data></Cell>

Both are likely to be the result of prolonged exposure to a low-gravity environment. Their physiology is intriguingly similar to our own, with most internal organs present in a recognisable form and a remarkably similar skeletal structure. A couple of exceptions are worth noting: a substantially enlarged cranium contains a corresponding increase in brain tissue, and vocal cords are atrophied to the point where verbal communication would be impossible. The latter suggests the creatures have transcended words; perhaps they have a telepathic link with one another?&#10;&#10;The body shows extensive signs of genetic modification at the cellular level. Caesan tissue possess only a single sex chromosome and, more importantly, samples taken from multiple enemy combatants shows they are genetically identical - that is, they are all clones. Genitalia are present but heavily atrophied. Asexual reproduction is obviously at work, but almost certainly facilitated by some form of technology. A metal valve on the upper spine is linked to the creature's circulatory system, which may indicate an artificial method of blood filtration that replaces excretion. An undersized liver and kidneys suggest it is certainly possible.

Whatever environment the Sebillians evolved in must have been a hostile one; their physiology is hardy to the point where I struggle to think of a creature capable of killing one. &#10;&#10;With up to an inch of scaled hide in places, these creatures have some inherent protection against ballistic weapons. Beneath the scales is a thick layer of dense muscle and the creature's heavy skeleton, both also heavily resistant to damage. Once we had abandoned our bone saws for an angle grinder, we revealed the creature's internal organs. These were much to be expected, the only major anomaly being the presence of two hearts inside the torso. Presumably one alone could not pump sufficient blood around the beast's body to sustain it? Analysis of Sebillian blood also has some interesting results: almost ten percent of blood volume is comprised of a mixture of powerful coagulants and unspecialised stem cells. We do not yet fully understand the implications of this, but it is quite possible that live Sebillians are able to rapidly clot wounds and possibly even regenerate damage sustained in combat. &#10;&#10;Some consolation: despite the above, Sebillians are not perfect soldiers. Much like the brutes down in our engineering department, their physique belies an undersize brain - a Sebillian probably has as much understanding of squad tactics as it does the finer points of Shakespeare. They also have weak thermal eyesight, giving them slower reflexes and poor accuracy (although smoke will not hinder their accuracy like it does other aliens). They will prefer to fight at short ranges where these characteristics are less of a hindrance, so it would be wise to ensure the opposite occurs. </Data></Cell>

We cannot even identify many of the instruments, but their collective role is obvious - recording data on the droid surroundings and feeding it to the processing units encased in its metal skull.&#10;&#10;While it is an extremely effective combat unit, we have genuine questions over why the Andron exists at all. The parallels with organic life are obvious and clearly deliberate. It has a reactor placed where a living creature would have a heart, an electronic brain inside its armoured head, even a power distribution system that mirrors the nervous system of a living creature. I can see no compelling reason to build a bipedal combat robot at all - a wheeled or tracked design would be more stable, faster moving, better protected and present a smaller battlefield target. Is it vanity? Stupidity? Puzzling, to say the least.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s74"><Data ss:Type="String">A Wraith stands roughly 180cm (6 foot) tall and is probably the most exotic of the extraterrestrials encountered to date. Only vaguely humanoid, it has triple-jointed legs and a bulbous head with a glowing, fleshy protrusion on each side. Disturbingly, they are reported to possess the ability to teleport around the battlefield - allegedly even through solid objects. &#10;&#10;Wraiths have a well-developed muscular system that is otherwise unremarkable, leaving them closely matched with humans in terms of strength and resilience. They possess four main internal organs, all of which are completely unrecognisable and appear to have hybrid functions. Each is protected by surgically implanted armour plating composed of the same materials used in UFO construction, though in this case it is only a few millimetres thick and possesses unusual flexibility. It appears both effective and unobtrusive; quite why subdermal armour is not present in other aliens we cannot say. This suggests these aliens have an important role within the alien hierarchy. Though I doubt we are looking at the alien leaders, the Wraiths may well represent the alien elite forces.&#10;&#10;The vast heads of these creatures contains a thick skull reinforced with protective armour plate, underneath which lies an expansive brain. The glowing nodules on either side of the skull comprise largely soft tissue packed with respiratory cells that produce immense amounts of energy (the glow seems to be a side-effect of this). These biological reactions consume almost fifty thousand calories every hour and thus cannot be a product of natural evolution. The only plausible explanation is that it is fed directly into the bloodstream through the ubiquitous valves surgically implanted into the necks of extraterrestrial soldiers. &#10;&#10;The other discovery of note is that these nodules sit atop an opening in the skull, meaning any blow of significant force would likely kill the creature outright (a bullet will certainly do the job). As the rest of the skull is well-protected, these nodules must be extremely important - likely linked to the power of teleportation. We plan to amputate them from any live specimen captured immediately to test the theory - if it does not teleport out of its containment tank once it regains consciousness, we will be proved correct. If not, I foresee having some difficulty interrogating the beast...</Data></Cell>

They are mysterious foes, head and chest encased within an armoured shell and the rest of their body covered by a jumpsuit. They are delicate and slender in stature, with unusually long limbs. Armed with long-range weapons and a jetpack integrated into their armour, they almost certainly serve as the alien marksmen.&#10;&#10;The armour of this creature formed as much of the autopsy as the body itself, as we found much to suggest it was not designed to be removed. There is evidence of an advanced rebreather system in the helmet that, coupled with the jumpsuit, would allow the creature to operate in any environment up to a hard vacuum.  A blood filtration unit in the chest actually forms part of the Harridan circulatory system, pumping the blood around the body whilst filtering out excreta and other waste products. The helmet includes powerful cameras capable of viewing almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum, giving the alien long sight ranges and excellent situational awareness.&#10;&#10;The jump pack integrated into the rear of the armour is effectively a miniaturised version of the same thrusters used on UFOs. The control system is a neural network - i.e. plugged directly into the creature's brain. This almost certainly allows them to operate their thrusters (and probably receive sensor information) subconsciously. I believe these creatures are actually the alien engineer caste; they are completely unaffected by a vacuum and can maneuver around in space using their thrusters, allowing them to work on the exterior of a spaceborne UFO just as easily as the interior.&#10;&#10;The alien beneath the armour bears some resemblance to a Caesan, possessing the same pallid grey skin, oversize black eyes and frail bone structure. A common ancestor is likely, but they have diverged significantly since - clearest in the lengthened forearms, drooping ears and bony spurs on either side of the creature's mouth. However, the largest difference is cerebral. The Caesan has an oversize brain with enhanced cognitive development structures; i.e. social hierarchies, memory recall, complex thought. The Harridan instead has enhanced structures in more basic areas; motor control, spatial awareness, visual analysis. It is an idiot savant, specialised into flight control and tool usage (unfortunately for us, a sniper rifle is ultimately just another type of tool).</Data></Cell>

It is a biological weapon of mass destruction, a monster that spreads death and terror in equal measure.&#10;&#10;Each Reaper is a parasitic creature that reproduces through implanting larvae inside other living organisms. These larvae secrete a chemical that disrupts the nervous system of the victim, leaving them shambling around in a state of damned half-life while the larvae gestate rapidly inside their body and metabolise it from within. Within a couple of minutes a fully-developed Reaper will burst free from the remnants of its host and head off in search of fresh victims (an implausibly short gestation period to occur naturally, so presumably alien technology has been used to accelerate it in some manner). In any case, this ability is highly troubling: the unfortunate host is likely to find the process unpleasant in the extreme, and it potentially allows these creatures to multiply quickly on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;They are well adapted to the role of finding and infesting their victims, possessing well-developed sensory organs and the ability to move across the battlefield with inhuman speed. Wiry but extremely strong, the beasts can easily generate enough force to penetrate personal armour with the large blades protruding from their shoulders. These blades are actually hollow, containing a muscular tube that houses the larvae and neurotoxic fluid to be injected into the victim once the blades have torn an opening into their flesh. A single attack is all that is required to reduce the victim to a hideous zombie, whatever personal armour they may be wearing.&#10;&#10;Despite this, these primal horrors have obvious weaknesses. A lack of ranged weaponry and the relative fragility of their chitin plates leaves them vulnerable if caught in the open or sighted at a distance. They also possess only rudimentary swarm intelligence, making them fearless and difficult to suppress but incapable of advanced tactics. This is truer still of the zombified hosts, which apparently simply lumber towards the nearest target and attempt to club them to death with their swollen fists. </Data></Cell>

Tissue analysis suggests these creatures are tens of millions of years older than any of the other alien species we have encountered; they are almost certainly the extraterrestrial command caste.&#10;&#10;The white armour these creatures wear is lightweight and presumably largely ceremonial in nature, offering little actual protection. The body beneath is underdeveloped, with a brittle skeleton and internal organs that are barely functional - indeed the creature's circulatory system is synthetic, driven by a powerful &quot;heart&quot; implanted between the shoulder blades. This supplies nutrients to the alien's prodigious brain, which is almost twice the size of the human equivalent and contains several extremely complex structures packed with respiratory cells that metabolise Alenium nanoparticles from the bloodstream. This would produce vast amounts of energy; we assume it is this that allows them to manifest their psionic abilities.&#10;&#10;This has powerful implications. These creatures have clearly surpassed the limits of their biology, engineering their brains and bodies to gain immense psionic powers. They long since passed the point where they can sustain themselves without their technology; even at rest their brains consume more energy than is generated by the average nuclear power plant.  Only regular infusions of Alenium nanoparticles can stave off fatal brain starvation. Has their machinery released them, or imprisoned them? Both, perhaps.&#10;&#10;Anyway, it goes without saying that the psionic strength of these creatures makes them extremely dangerous on the battlefield. You should also expect them to be difficult to kill, as I strongly suspect that their psionic powers grant them far more protection than conventional armour ever would.</Data></Cell>

It is capable of hovering, but is usually sighted skimming the battlefield roughly a metre above the ground. This allows it to move freely over small obstacles or otherwise impassable terrain (such as water).&#10;&#10;Disassembly of recovered wreckage suggests that the heart of the drone is an Alenium reactor no larger than a man's fist.  We assume the mass of alien circuitry that surrounds it is, in fact, the drone's electronic brain. The lack of any visible receiver antennae suggests that these units are fully autonomous when operational. An engine array on the rear of drone provides forward motion, while the hover effect (and probably pitch and roll) is generated by the dozen small thrusters that dot the underside of the drone. The frontal part of the saucer is filled with a powerful scanner that can monitor almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum, giving these drones excellent sight ranges.&#10;&#10;The drone is armed with an unusual integrated weapon we have dubbed the &quot;burst cannon&quot;. The plasma generation array has been designed to emphasise rate of fire above all else, allowing it to fire extremely quickly but leaving it underpowered even compared to the Plasma Pistol - a single shot would probably not even kill an unarmoured civilian. As the shell of the drone itself is also not even thick enough to resist sustained small arms fire, I suspect these units are disposable scout units primarily designed to locate and suppress enemies so the accompanying aliens can deal with them more easily. A support role rather than a hunter-killer role, it seems.</Data></Cell>

We believe the inch-thick armoured shell is fabricated from the same lightweight but durable materials as used in the fighter-class UFOs, predictably far more effective against infantry weapons than the powerful missiles and cannons. There are also striking similarities in terms of flight control circuitry and weapon array that suggest a common ancestor. Other elements appear to have been drawn from the Light Drone, such as the powerful frontal scanner and central Alenium reactor - though naturally both of these have also been significantly enlarged.&#10;&#10;The formidable weapon system is worth mentioning for two reasons. Firstly, it generates large amounts of highly-charged plasma and is capable of firing multiple shots in quick succession. Each of these is a powerful explosive in its own right, capable of killing or seriously injuring an armoured soldier. The second reason is that the array stores excess power from the drone's reactor and subsequently uses it to boost rate of fire. This system works perfectly well until the drone is destroyed, at which point any excess energy would be released in the form of a secondary explosion capable of killing or injuring anything nearby. </Data></Cell>

If it is any consolation, I do not believe it physically possible for the aliens to get much tougher than this.&#10;&#10;There is no question that this report is discussing an alien heavy assault unit. The armour on these beasts is the same stuff as is found on the exterior of alien capital ships, and is extremely difficult to cut in the laboratory (thankfully, your men had already punched a few holes in it). It is present in sufficiently large quantities to force the extraterrestrials to switch to using an anti-gravity emitter to keep it airborne; it is far too heavy to hover using conventional thrusters. Consequently these units are exceptionally difficult to destroy and best tackled with heavy weapons. &#10;&#10;The main cannon built onto the drone should be familiar, as you will previously have encountered it as the primary armament of the alien Corvette UFO. Not only is it an eye-wateringly powerful battlefield weapon that inflicts major splash damage around the initial impact point, it also means the Heavy Drone suffers from the same energy-release issues as its predecessor. The increased size of the drone makes the resulting detonation still more spectacular; it will likely kill nearby units outright.</Data></Cell>

Even the ubiquitous jumpsuit offers remarkable protection and is supplemented with additional protective gear at higher ranks. &#10;&#10;Scans have revealed that the brain tissue of these creatures is unusually active, with samples taken during autopsies suggesting that it is extraordinarily rich in energy-dense Alenium nanoparticles. As we have already established that these creatures communicate via telepathy, this hints at further (as yet unknown) mental abilities.

The tests confirmed our initial suspicions: Sebillians possess only rudimentary intelligence, have bad eyesight and struggle to operate firearms. However, they are remarkably agile for such hulking creatures and can cover ground surprisingly quickly. &#10;&#10;They also possess astonishing regenerative abilities. Unless the creature is actually dead, it will regenerate virtually any damage sustained to its body (brain included) in a matter of minutes. This ability seems to arise from unspecialised stem cells in the Sebillian bloodstream, which replicate at an incredible rate and can replace complex organs such as eyes or nerves just as easily as simpler structures such as muscle tissue. Clearly, the volume of tissue being regenerated is too great for this to be a natural process. We believe inherent regenerative abilities are being supercharged by the nanoparticles of Alenium in alien blood serum, providing the vast quantity of energy needed to rebuild entire body parts in minutes rather than weeks.&#10;&#10;This analysis has brought two tangible results. The first is an upgrade to our battlefield medipacks, which borrow from alien nanotechnology to help stabilise battlefield injuries (sadly full-blown tissue regeneration would require decades of genetic engineering). These improved medipacks replace our previous ones and will heal at twice the rate. The second result is a summary of known Sebillian weaknesses, which should cause your men to inflict approximately ten percent more damage when fighting these enemies.&#10;</Data></Cell>

The larval growth process begins the growth process, but is not actually required to complete it - if the zombie is terminated before gestation is complete, an immature Reaper bursts free of the host's corpse and springs into action. These immature Reapers mature in a matter of minutes and seem just as combat-effective as adult Reapers, so bear in mind that gunning down a zombie may not be beneficial in every situation.  While I am not sure what the aliens have done to enhance the original Reapers, there is no doubt that they have evolved into the very definition of a terror weapon.</Data></Cell>

Interestingly, it seemed happy to thoughtlessly follow simple orders issued by my team (such as moving across its cell). Eventually, once it had become clear that no more could be gained from questioning the creature, one of my team handed it a pistol and ordered it to kill itself. It promptly complied, splattering its brains across half the containment tank. It seems the alien soldiers are just mindless thralls; I suppose we will need to capture an alien officer if we are to get the answers we seek. Oh, and before you get too excited: reproducing the &quot;suicide effect&quot; on the battlefield is completely impractical (it requires a stationary target and laboratory full of equipment).</Data></Cell>

There is a reason for this: alien Officers are highly intelligent, and do not lead their troops in battle so much as directly possess them. I would suggest that the word &quot;Officer&quot; is a misnomer; &quot;Controller&quot; would be more appropriate.&#10;&#10;The alien mindset is strange. We were already aware the same species and rank were identical clones, but it seems that these creatures actually consider themselves interchangeable. Not exactly a collective consciousness, more that they simply have no concept of &quot;self&quot;. Provided one of their clones survives, they would not consider themselves to be dead. This makes interrogation a struggle - not only is it difficult to threaten a creature which cannot grasp the concept of its own death, choosing the correct pronoun when asking a question becomes a minefield. Nonetheless, we managed to glean a little useful information: the captive confirmed the intention of the invasion was to kill humans individually, but not collectively. It seems they are not actually trying to wipe us out. &#10;&#10;In truth, this is nothing we did not already know. If the aliens wanted to annihilate us, they could simply have bombed us into extinction from orbit. The invasion evidently has a higher purpose, but we could not extract it from our captive. We will have to capture an alien Leader to learn more.</Data></Cell>

This empire has existed for millennia, linked by ships that can travel interstellar distances in days. With no rivals to define itself against, it seemingly has no name. They believe no other interstellar civilisation exists, or ever has.&#10;&#10;This empire is ruled by a caste of living god-creatures known as the Praetors. While the lesser creatures are clones that follow orders unquestioningly, these Praetors seem distinct individuals locked in an endless struggle with one another for power and influence. Low-ranking praetors are apparently present on the largest alien craft / bases, overseeing the work of their underlings directly. These creatures will surely know the true reason why the extraterrestrials have travelled to our planet, the real reasons behind the invasion. We must capture one alive, whatever the cost may be.&#10;&#10;I have little doubt the task will be difficult. During the questioning of our captive, I could not help but notice the interrogation team becoming steadily less adversarial - indeed, after six hours, they had almost become friendly. Alarmed, I called a halt to the experiment and had the captive terminated. It emerged that one of my scientists had slipped into a trance during the interrogation and surreptitiously begun building a bomb large enough to blow up half the facility. Given a few more hours, he might well have finished the job. Dark days, Commander: it appears these creatures are capable of manipulating our very minds.</Data></Cell>

Our captive is evidently terrified by the possibility of death and proved exceptionally compliant during the interrogation.&#10;&#10;The Praetors are an ancient race that developed hyperspace technology millions of years ago. Their history was unremarkable until they encountered the Caesans. The Caesans of old had settled their home system, but did not possess the hyperdrive technology they needed to travel beyond it. What they did possess was the power of telepathy, along with several other latent psionic abilities. It proved their undoing; craving the powers for themselves, the Praetors subjugated the Caesans and studied them until they identified the genetic material responsible.&#10;&#10;They improved this genetic material and granted themselves extraordinary psionic powers. They became a race of intergalactic tyrants, seeking out and enslaving sentient life in endless pursuit of &quot;improvements&quot; (e.g. the biological immortality extracted from the Sebillians). The useful species were retained, genetically re-sequenced to ensure submission and servitude.&#10;&#10;This is the fate planned for us. Our enemies toy with us - this invasion is just a test. The High Praetor measures our progress from the bridge of the enormous alien mothership orbiting our planet. Without him, the fleet would collapse...but then the extraterrestrials would simply jump in a new fleet. There would be no end. At best, we would have the choice between extinction or subjugation. Neither much appeals.&#10;&#10;The rules must change, Commander. I have an idea...just give me a little time to develop it.</Data></Cell>

The aliens have miscalculated: even the fastest alien ship can only reach a tenth of lightspeed using conventional propulsion, leaving them reliant on hyperspace technology for interstellar travel. &#10;&#10;We already have a fully functional hyperspace inhibitor in our laboratory. The principle behind it is derived from radio jamming - it generates vast amounts of randomised &quot;noise&quot; that causes a destabilising cascade in any nearby hyperspace tunnel, causing it to collapse on itself before any travel can occur. It should inhibit all hyperspace travel for a thousand light years around our planet, preventing the arrival of any alien reinforcements.&#10;&#10;However, activating the device now would be suicide. The alien fleet in orbit are hardly likely to maintain the charade of invasion once the disruptor comes online. Indeed, there is a failsafe for this exact scenario: the alien Dreadnought carries enough Reapers to eradicate all life on the planet. If unleashed on a population centre, there would be tens of millions of the creatures within hours. Once they had overwhelmed humanity, the Praetors could gather up the Reapers and pick through the absorbed genetic material at their leisure. A depressingly neat solution.&#10;&#10;But even this would give us a small window of opportunity. A single strike team could land on the Dreadnought as it descends into our atmosphere. If they can find and kill the High Praetor before the Reapers are unleashed on our planet, the alien fleet would be left leaderless and defeated, their reinforcements stranded thousands of years away. But if your men were to fail, the entire human race would die with them.&#10;&#10;This mission is &quot;Operation Endgame&quot;.

You must act quickly - the Reapers from the lower decks will begin clambering through the access tubes towards the bridge as soon as the High Praetor calls them. They will take some time to arrive, but there will be too many to fight.

Two small thrusters mounted on the back of the saucer provide propulsion. The craft does not appear to have a reactor of any kind, instead seeming to draw power from rechargeable capacitors in the wings. It is almost certainly not capable of independent operation, instead it would need to be launched from a &quot;home&quot; vessel at the start of each mission (and return there afterwards).&#10;&#10;It has poor combat performance for such an advanced vessel; it is no match for one of our Condor interceptors. The main weapon is an energy cannon mounted beneath the saucer, which has a relatively slow fire speed and a shorter range than our Sidewinder missiles. The armoured shell is remarkably strong and impressively heat-resistant given it is only a few millimetres thick, but is too thin to offer much protection against modern munitions.

The large engines mounted in the rear of the vessel are enough to keep it airborne, but it is slow and ponderous compared to the lighter craft that preceded it (and therefore vulnerable to heavy torpedoes). The power requirements of these engines necessitate both a second power core and an improved method of power transmission - the hull electronics are much more advanced than previously, so we have extracted them for further study. &#10;&#10;The primary armament of the Corvette is a forward-firing heavy plasma cannon. This has a slow rate of fire, but generates a powerful explosive projectile that is just as deadly when used to bomb ground targets as it is when used against aerial opponents. These projectiles travel relatively slowly and you may find that our more agile interceptors are able to avoid them with an evasive roll maneuver, but they will inflict heavy damage on anything they hit.

These two rooms are joined by a pair of teleportation devices that instantaneously transport any unit that steps onto one of the platforms over to the other. Despite studying them extensively, we still have no idea at all how these devices function. &#10;&#10;Almost as interesting is the armour plating on the exterior of the ship. It requires immense firepower to crack one of these vessels open, which we assumed was due to more extensive armour plating - but, troublingly, the Landing Ship actually has much less armour plate than the Corvette. We have taken samples of this hardened plate for further study. The vessel's primary weapon is just a scaled up version of the cannon on the Corvette, but it also possesses a smaller rapid-fire secondary weapon that packs sufficient punch to make a frontal approach inadvisable.</Data></Cell>

The majority of the craft's support systems are housed in the wings, most notably the life support systems on the inside and the fine maneuvering thrusters on the exterior edge. The pressurised crew compartments contain both cargo space and the vessel's reactors, leaving space in the saucer for extra armour plate and the main weapon - a powerful plasma cannon, apparently scaled-up from the Corvette cannon. &#10;&#10;Interestingly, the protective armour plating has an uneven distribution. The upper section of the saucer protects the command room and has armour over twice as thick as that of the wings, making it highly resistant to incoming fire (one would imagine it also offers added protection for alien assault squads on the final approach to the designated terror site).

A trio of deadly rapid-firing plasma cannons and an enlarged &quot;missile&quot; tube in each wing complete the design, producing an exceptional dogfighter: fast, tough, agile and well-armed. &#10;&#10;It is both sobering and encouraging to remember that it is clearly designed as a spacecraft - while I dread to think how effective this craft must be in the cold interstellar vacuum, it suggests we may yet be able to build something to defeat it in the skies. </Data></Cell>

Though easy prey for our interceptors, it can quickly rain death and destruction on a funding nation and sour our relations accordingly.&#10;&#10;It employs two linked electromagnetic torpedo launch tracks to do so, forming a semi-circular structure on the rear half of the saucer. Each torpedo is powerful enough to sink a ship and we believe the Bomber capable of launching a pair every six seconds, making casualties from any strafing run a virtual certainty. Thankfully, they are unguided and travel too slowly to be of any practical use against aerial targets, making the Bomber vulnerable in combat.&#10;&#10;The entire craft has been designed around these weapons. The thin wings jutting out from either side of the saucer are likely intended to stabilise the craft during an attack run, while the saucer itself is largely hollow and presumably mostly used for ammunition storage (the Harridan pilot, craft reactor and avionics are all crammed into a small area at the front). We actually believe that this is the reason why little of these UFOs survives an interception, as the remaining torpedoes tend to detonate either immediately or on impact with the ground. In short, the Bomber is an underwhelming combatant, but one that must be dealt with quickly.</Data></Cell>

Though clearly a derivative of the standard Cruiser UFO design, it fulfils a role more akin to that of the Bomber.&#10;&#10;Despite its vast size we believe the Strike Cruiser is still a single-seater craft, the pilot interred somewhere in the forward area of the saucer. All non-essential systems have been stripped away and replaced with extra firepower, the biggest addition being the two enormous coilguns mounted on the front of the craft. A lattice of heatsinks connect each one to the &quot;wings&quot; of the craft, which themselves contain powerful long-range targeting scanners.&#10;&#10;These coilguns appear designed to attack static targets from great range and pose little threat to our aircraft, making the Strike Cruiser a weak combatant. Each projectile is highly explosive and capable of flattening a building in a single hit; given that the saucer section of each craft can carry at least thirty of them it is imperative that these UFOs are shot down before they inflict too much damage on the nations that fund us. Predictably, the explosive payload of the Strike Cruiser makes it highly unlikely a successful interception will leave much in the way of recoverable wreckage.</Data></Cell>

The Condor's Autocannon makes it well-suited to destroying smaller craft, whilst it also carries Sidewinder light missiles to make it a credible threat to medium-size vessels.&#10;&#10;The Condor has broadly similar performance to its parent aircraft but uses a modified airframe built from a titanium / magnesium alloy that gives the interceptor a reduced payload, but significantly longer range and improved durability. The alterations to the airframe have been made based on our studies of F-4 Phantoms damaged during the Iceland Incident. Components containing titanium or magnesium appeared to sustain less damage than those made of aluminium or other materials, suggesting some inherent resistance to alien energy weapons. We hope this reinforced airframe will make our Condors more capable against alien UFOs than interceptors from conventional air forces. &#10;&#10;The increased range is believed necessary - we have rather a lot of planet to protect. This has reduced the payload of the Condor, but it is still able to carry two light missiles and a craft cannon. This is a versatile combination; Sidewinder missiles have been proved effective and reliable against human aircraft, but we do not even know if we will be able to get a missile lock on alien vessels. The cannon has a shorter range and fires powerful shells that should be useful in a dogfight. One of the two weapons should hopefully prove effective against an enemy vessel.</Data></Cell>

It serves the Xenonauts as a dropship, ferrying up to eight men and their equipment to combat zones almost anywhere in the world. &#10;&#10;The Charlie has been heavily modified for Xenonaut use. The operational range of the craft has been vastly increased, allowing it to reach almost any destination in the world on a single tank of fuel (it can also be refuelled mid-air if the local government are feeling sufficiently cooperative). It has also been fitted with heavier armour, as our strike teams are expected to &quot;hot drop&quot; into combat areas and may come under fire immediately - losing our dropship to ground fire during landing / the subsequent mission would hardly be ideal. Though necessary, this has unfortunately reduced the carrying capacity down to eight men.&#10;&#10;The Charlie is slow and defenceless, making it easy prey for alien craft. Your strike team is likely to take casualties if their dropship is shot down, so it may be worth adding interceptors to the Charlie's squadron if there is any UFO activity in the target area.</Data></Cell>

The Sidewinders will allow us to damage the craft before getting into range of their weapons, turning the tide of the battle in our favour. Using multiple interceptors in the same squadron may even allow us to destroy an alien craft in a barrage of Sidewinders without taking any damage ourselves. &#10;&#10;A Sidewinder cannot be fired until the interceptor has missile lock on the target - this requires keeping the target in range and in front of the interceptor for a couple of seconds.

It is a perfectly capable weapon at close ranges, but is primarily useful as a sidearm (e.g. for snipers) or when the soldier has something else in their other hand (e.g. a grenade or a combat shield). Also, please note that absolutely no combat advantage is gained by dual-wielding these weapons. It is simply childish.&#10;&#10;The Shotgun fires shells that break into several shots, making it most effective when the spread is small and all of the shot strikes a single target. It can be fired relatively quickly and does considerable damage at short-range, but it is completely ineffective at long range. It is best used as a breaching weapon and for close-quarter work, where it can bring down hostile units faster than our other weapons.&#10;&#10;The Assault Rifle is the most versatile of our weapons, accurate at all ranges and capable of burst fire. It cannot be fired as quickly as the Pistol / Shotgun and it does not do as much damage as other weapons, but it is useful in practically any situation. It is always worth having a backbone of rifle-armed troops on combat missions.&#10;&#10;The Precision Rifle is a marksman's rifle. It does additional damage per shot than the Rifle and is more accurate, but takes additional time to aim and cannot use burst fire. It is not a very efficient weapon at short range, but it is king where there are large open spaces and good sight lines.</Data></Cell>

It is not particularly accurate, but has a long range and can be very effective at suppressing the enemy. It has significant recoil, making it most accurate in the hands of our stronger soldiers. Naturally, it is possible to inflict heavy damage on our enemies with this weapon (particularly if they have been caught out in the open or are in a large group) but it should be considered primarily as a support weapon that will pin them in place.&#10;&#10;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Rocket Launcher fires rockets at our enemies.

Better our men know exactly where their comrades are at all times.&#10;&#10;We should be able to design protective equipment tailored to defend against alien weapons once we have captured and studied a few examples.

An alien craft entered our atmosphere above the Atlantic in what we now believe was a scouting mission. It was detected and intercepted by NATO jets operating under the assumption it was an experimental Soviet aircraft.&#10;&#10;Visual sighting of the UFO rapidly dispelled that myth - the craft was far larger than its radar signature suggested, more akin to an airborne warship than an aircraft. Attempts to communicate elicited a barrage of energy weapon fire that disintegrated half of the squadron and left the remaining jets limping back to base with severe damage. Several subsequent attempts were made by NATO fighter squadrons to intercept the alien vessel, costing them a number of aircraft but inflicting no appreciable damage on the target. When the UFO abruptly changed course and began heading for the eastern coast of the United States, the decision was made to deploy nuclear weapons. &#10;&#10;Twenty minutes later, half a dozen nuclear-tipped ICBM ignited the sky above an uninhabited part of Iceland.  Astonishingly, the UFO survived the blast - but it crash-landed, almost intact, shortly afterwards. At this point, the NATO forces made the decision to inform their Soviet counterparts about the alien vessel and seek their assistance in securing the vessel and the technology within. This decision was seemingly motivated more by self-preservation rather than altruism; the Soviets were furious at the large unexplained nuclear detonations and were apparently close to launching missiles of their own.&#10;&#10;A joint ground operation was launched to capture the alien craft, but numerous extraterrestrials had survived the crash and put up stiff resistance. Human forces took significant losses during the operation, but slowly secured the area around the craft. What happened next is uncertain - all we know is that the alien craft was destroyed in an enormous explosion, almost certainly caused by the craft's power source. This explosion annihilated the UFO itself and wiped out all ground forces within a ten mile radius (the only survivors were those at the distant command post). There was nothing left; the UFO was gone and only a handful of those who had sighted an extraterrestrial were left alive.&#10;&#10;The aftermath of the Incident involved a large scale cover-up. The official explanation was that of a Soviet invasion of Iceland thwarted by nuclear weapons, with heavy losses on both sides. But behind closed doors, the two superpowers were collaborating - a joint black ops organisation was formed, drawing from the resources of both. Unofficially dubbed the &quot;Xenonauts&quot;, it was tasked with defending the planet against alien invasion. The absence of an obvious alien threat has made us look rather irrelevant for the past twenty years, Commander - but we had little doubt we would be needed some day. It seems that day has come.&#10;&#10;&lt;i&gt;(The free novella Xenonauts: Crimson Dagger tells the story of the Iceland Incident and is included with the game under the &quot;Extras&quot; button of the game launcher)&lt;/i&gt;</Data></Cell>

The Singularity Cannon is so heavy that it can only be wielded with assistance from a Predator battlesuit, but it is capable of unleashing almost unimaginable destructive power.&#10;&#10;The device is built around a Singularity Core and functions by siphoning off a tiny fraction of the energy held within, then imparting it into a specially-designed slug of alien materials. This slug consists largely of looped superconducting alloys, the only substances able to contain the enormous quantity of energy involved. The slug is then projected at high speed towards the target using our existing MAG technology, deforming on impact and thus breaking the superconductor loop. This causes a vast release of energy and similarly enormous damage to anything that happens to be in the area. The effect is not quite as extreme as the blast from one of our Singularity Torpedoes, but the results are still astonishing.&#10;&#10;The Singularity Cannon requires reloading with a new slug after each time it is fired, but the Core itself should be good for approximately a million shots. Constructing one would be a major undertaking, but the sheer power of the weapon would surely be worth it - I seriously doubt the aliens have anything that could survive a hit from this weapon; I can assure you that our species does not.</Data></Cell>

Each is an individual bolt of plasma fired from one of the weapon's three entirely separate barrels. The device employs a particularly large generation array, which allows all three of the barrels to simultaneously discharge a bolt of plasma that is almost as powerful as the bolt fired by the alien Plasma Rifle. This makes the weapon highly dangerous at short range: if all three shots strike the same target, it is unlikely to survive the experience.&#10;&#10;Thankfully, this weapon is inaccurate, has mediocre armour penetration and a very limited range - it does not appear to utilise the standard graviton emitter seen on other alien weapons at all.

Surprisingly, however, the device proved utterly inert once switched off - not even appearing to radiate heat.&#10;&#10;The construction of the device is equally peculiar. It consists of a cylindrical outer casing of alien ceramics, the interior of which is dotted with hundreds of tiny laser emitters. Sitting inside this is a rotating inner casing that is packed with a lattice of unidentified yellow crystal, again cylindrical in shape. The origin and composition of these crystals has yet to be determined, but there is no question that they form the heart of the reactor. For want of a better name, my team have dubbed the material &quot;Alenium&quot; and are in the process of removing the lattice from the casing to allow further study. Preliminary scans suggest that there is an almost incomprehensible amount of energy stored within these Alenium crystals, despite the lattice being no larger than a football. This material is potentially one of the greatest discoveries of recent times; we should begin research on it immediately.&#10;&#10;The rest of the power source contains little of interest. All of the materials used in its construction have been encountered in larger quantities elsewhere in the hulls of recovered UFOs and the machinery itself is not overly complex; studying it has yielded nothing worth commenting upon. The only mystery surrounds the sea of identical laser emitters covering the interior of the outer coating - we are as yet unaware of their purpose. Studying a couple of examples have provided only minor advances in our understanding of laser technology, mostly in the areas of beam focusing and miniaturisation of optical amplifiers. I very much doubt that the aliens are unable to produce far more powerful laser emitters, suggesting that they have deliberately been designed to only emit low intensity beams. We would be interested to know the significance of this with regards to the Alenium lattice; it may give us an avenue of research when we begin to study it.&#10;&#10;Finally, I understand you have received a request (from personnel in a department which will remain nameless) seeking to prevent me from dismantling such devices inside the base in future. I must object to the repeated usage of the phrase &quot;reckless disregard&quot; and I can assure you I am no more keen to end my life in an enormous fireball than anyone else in this base. I therefore request you tell the staff concerned to stick to what they know (i.e. building things, making unintelligible grunting noises)...</Data></Cell>

The ceramic shell contains a small plasma generation array activated by pressing a button on the top of device. Unlike the generation array alien infantry weapons, the Alien Grenade makes no attempt to focus or shape the resulting projectile - instead it exhausts its entire Alenium power supply in a single moment and dumps all of the plasma into the surrounding area in the form of a sizeable explosion.&#10;&#10;There is thus no fragmentation element to the damage inflicted by the Alien Grenade - it is purely an energy weapon. This gives the device a relatively limited blast radius and a rapid drop-off in power from the epicenter of the blast to the edge, but also means that it will be deadly to any units caught near the middle of the blast until we develop more advanced infantry body armour. It is highly recommended that commanders avoid bunching their troops together in a manner that may attract an Alien Grenade.&#10;&#10;Additionally, our scientists have adapted the design of the Alien Grenade to create the Alenium Grenade. This device contains a core of Alenium crystals studded with miniaturised lasers, surrounded by a conventional fragmentation shell fabricated from Alien Alloys. Once triggered, the Alenium crystals detonate and propel the razor-sharp shrapnel through the blast area at far higher speeds than a normal grenade can muster. &#10;&#10;Preliminary tests suggest that the Alenium Grenade has a similar blast radius to the conventional Fragmentation Grenade, but inflicts up to 50% more damage to anything caught within. These grenades are now available for production in the Workshop.</Data></Cell>

Meaning no disrespect to R&amp;D, but interpreting ET strategy is best suited to the men who do it for a living. I'll be keeping you updated on whatever we can discover about extraterrestrial UFO activity.;Earlier today there was a confirmed sighting of a UFO, light scout class, circling low over a research station in America. It didn’t take any visible action but local radio operators detected unusual bursts of energy in the VHF band, and the researchers detected simultaneous bursts in the SHF band. I've cross-linked this with similar reports in Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. Considering the strategic importance of the locations involved and the analysis of light scouts from R&amp;D, I'm certain these scouts were gathering and transmitting intelligence on potential future targets ;UFOs on scouting missions remain in the air for an extended period of time, gathering intel on potential targets. There doesn't seem to be any particular plan to what they cover, so it should be fairly easy to intercept one. As the ETs have dedicated ships for scouting, you can expect scouting missions to be carried out by small signals. The more intel a scout can gather, the more damaging later attacks will be so try and get as many scouts taken down as you can. Even if we can’t recover the crash site, we can at least make sure the ETs are fighting in the dark.</Data></Cell>

They’re mostly scenes of unusual, almost paranormal activity – such as storms suddenly appearing out of nowhere, eerie glowing lights, and signs of unexplained cattle mutilation. I even have a report from a man who claims to have been abducted then rejected by his abductors. The ETs seem to be carrying out some kind of research, but for what reason we don’t know.;Research missions seem to be restricted to their scout ships who will scan a pre-defined area, looking for suitable subjects and locations to carry out their experiments. Scouts doing research will also land fairly frequently to obtain samples and carry out field work. Research missions can result in casualties, but nothing major. Whatever they're up to Commander, I think it's better we don't get a chance to find out. Don't you?</Data></Cell>

A short while ago – we can’t be sure exactly when - a UFO slipped through the net and targeted, get this, a music festival! The organisers had held it in an open field, in the mistaken belief that UFOs only attacked towns. Reports suggest the ETs took less than a quarter of an hour to turn most of the festival goers into ash. The reason I’m bringing this to you because this wasn’t an airstrike – the ETs used ground teams to carry out this massacre.;We don‘t have a lot to go on – our sponsors got to the few witnesses who survived first, and while we have now have transcripts of the interviews, there are maddening gaps in the information. What we can be certain of was there were a significant number of ETs involved in this attack, and they had deployed some sort of man-sized Frankenstein which got fried by an unshielded power cable. ;My team thinks this was a test run and we can expect further attacks by cadres of alien shock troops, tasked with terrorising funding nations by slaughtering the civilian population. One of my juniors who’s a history buff drew a parallel between this and a method used by Genghis Khan. He’d obliterate a city and threaten other cities with the very real threat of vanishing as well if they resisted. ;Successful terror attacks are the most damaging of any alien mission to our organisation. Our sponsors have strongly hinted that nuclear protocols will be deployed to prevent what they call “biological contamination”. The politicians will blame us to keep Joe Citizen off their backs and our funding and reputation takes a hit that’s hard to come back from. If we do save a city from the ETs that will look particularly good for us and we can expect a big boost in funding for every terror site we clean up. UFOs on a terror missions are medium-grade signals at a minimum, and they are almost always escorted. They will try to throw us off the scent, so look for slow moving signals which move randomly but seem to be circling a specific patch of cities - they are likely on a terror mission.</Data></Cell>

If they all landed tomorrow we’d be dead. As it is, the ETs have &quot;merely&quot; committed to the largest air war since Hitler was in power. ;Pattern analysis of ET airstrikes suggests they’re currently focussing on “soft” targets - highways, small towns, even isolated warships on patrol. These targets are difficult for emergency services to respond to and the ETs ability to strike and retreat anywhere makes it hard for local forces concentrated nearer the larger population centers to intercept. ;Ground attack missions can be carried out by any grade of signal, from the smallest to the largest. Rather than being given a specific target, UFOs will patrol a patch of the planet looking for targets of opportunity. UFOs tasked with a ground attack mission will strike several times before retreating to rearm and refuel and can cause serious havoc.  ;They’re damned clever, Commander. They strike at locations that make no immediate military or economic impact, but they whittle away at our confidence and cut lines of commerce and communication. If we become isolated, the planet will shut down as effectively as if they bombed every capital into rubble. Our experience and detection tech gives us a fighting chance against ET strikes, but the fact is there are too many of them and too few of us to handle them all at once. My advice is to get as many bases built as you can. Never mind R&amp;D’s bleating for more funds. Those nerds have no idea of how the real world works and we need boots on the ground, not heads in the sky.</Data></Cell>

We’ve mapped the route and it intersects the industrial zones of several cities as well as a classified submarine dock. The timing is too tight and the sites too large for ground landings but adequate for a string of rapid, heavy airstrikes. Commander, it looks like the ETs are going to step up their air campaign. ;We can expect ET bombers to target strategic, economic and civilian targets of significance, but with a whole planet to pick from it’s going to be difficult to predict  where they’re going to strike. Thankfully, if this flight plan is any indication, it looks like they’ll be tasked with several targets in each run which exposes them to attack by our interceptors. Bombers are very likely to be escorted, and will be a medium-class signal or larger. Look for medium signals with an erratic flight pattern but no recorded landings – those are the most likely targets. ;Predicted casualties from a strike are expected to be the hundreds, so shut them down as a priority Commander. We can always send in a team to deal with ground landings, but bombing runs can only be intercepted. </Data></Cell>

Look at the photos here, and here. You can see they’ve used some kind of device to bore several tunnels into the rock. Unfortunately, this isn’t just simple-minded vandalism. This is something more sinister. ;The ET’s orbital fleet gives them the freedom to strike at any target in any part of the globe. This freedom is restricted by their lines of supply. ET UFOs need to head back to their motherships to refuel, which the eggheads tell me is physically taxing even for their advanced technology. Their fleet itself must need a massive and ongoing supply operation to provide it with everything it needs.  ;The logical step is to construct forward operating bases on the planet as places for refitting and repairing smaller craft, staging areas for ground-based missions and supply dumps for foraging expeditions to reduce supply dependency. These tunnels look like test bores to see if that mountainside would be a suitable candidate. Pity they didn’t do their homework, eh? ;National landscapes beside, we can expect ET bases to be set up in remote locations away from centres of population. This will make it hard to track them down. I’ve dispatched agents to gather what information they can and our analysts are pouring over historical UFO sighting data but this will take time and it isn’t a reliable source of information. The most reliable way to detect an ET base is by tracing UFO activity. ;Only medium-class signals or higher will carry out base construction missions. Look for medium signals that land, take off again and land shortly after, doing this several times. That’s a sign the ETs are surveying sites to see if they are suitable for a base. ;Their bases will need essential supplies they can’t manufacture themselves, and their landing craft are well suited as haulers. So also look for medium-class signals which  dawdle over locations that doesn’t seem to be either a city or your own bases. If you follow those craft to their end destination, they should lead you to the location of the ET base.  ;ET bases are parasites that will sap the will of the funding nation they are attached to. While they don’t have an obvious short-term effect, over the long term they are as dangerous as any direct alien attack.</Data></Cell>

The most notorious attack to date has been on a deep nuclear launch facility. A covert group of ETs were able to access the base despite most of it being half a mile underground. It was only by collapsing the residential wing that the base commander saved anything. That worries me, because if the ETs are doing it to the nationals, sooner or later they’ll do it to us. ;The consequence of ETs successfully attacking one of our bases is the loss of all operational assets in the base and the particular area covered by the base will be  undefended until we can construct a new one. Even if we drive them off  ETs can cause lasting damage by wrecking hangars, destroying labs and demolishing workshops. Don’t sit about and wait for the ETs, Commander. Go and meet them in force! ;Without a way of intercepting and decoding alien communications, it’ll be hard to tell if a UFO is going to mount an attack on our base or if they’re intending to attack a city. Look for escorted medium-class signals and above. They aren’t going to make it obvious that they’re going for us, but sooner or later they will have to head directly to our base. The bases most likely to be attacked will be the ones they have the most operational data on – i.e. the oldest.

I’m certain she was intending to breach the quarantine seals on the Caesan subject we have had under study. “Thankfully” she opened the Reaper larvae maturation pod instead. The silver lining on this cloud is that we have been able to closely study the effects of Reaper larvae metamorphosis. Pursuant to your request on more information about Reapers, I have drawn together what we know about their class structure and appended what data we have on Reaper zombies as well.  ;Alpha Reaper: As if the standard Reaper weren’t bad enough, we have identified certain Reapers who are faster, stronger and more resilient than their common brethren. These “alpha” Reapers are relatively few in number but they are just as fecund as the standard Reaper. Left unchecked they can reduce cities to gibbering zombie hordes in short order. The Alpha Reaper is identifiable by its lighter hue. ;Zombie: The zombie resembles a hunchbacked waxwork that’s been stood too close to the fire. Facial features run together and the limbs become elongated, muscle-bound and misshapen. The hunch, from which the rapidly maturing larvae will burst from is lined with blotchy veins. In this state zombies can do little more than swing their limbs while screaming in pain and rage. Don’t let a zombie get too close! The hosts’ death triggers a hyperaccelerated burst of growth in the larvae, and you don’t want the birth scream of a new Reaper to chime with the death rattle of your soldiers. ;Alpha Zombie: Alpha zombies are superficially the same shape, but the processes which create the alpha supercharge the zombie. Their shapes are more capable of bearing the extra load of an alpha, and as a consequence they are faster, stronger and more resilient. ;Be very careful if your own troops are infected, Commander. While they don’t have the brains to use their weapons, they still wear the tattered remains of their armour and it will provide more protection than the torn clothing that graces civilian zombies.</Data></Cell>

If a test subject manages to breach quarantine, the correct response is to subdue and restrain it until our specialists can get to the scene. It is most emphatically not to grab whatever is to hand and reinact the more bloody scenes from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, even if the subject does manage to teleport into the canteen and scare the occupants. When your brutes had finished, there wasn’t enough left of the Wraith for tissue analysis. ;Like Harridans, Wraiths have a truncated class structure. This is probably to do with their elite status in the alien hierarchy – no Wraith need sully its hands with manual labour! While Wraith battle armour is a uniform green, we have noticed a considerable amount of personalisation with no suit exactly the same. This is probably how Wraiths distinguish themselves socially and indicates that Wraiths have a surprising level of independent thought in the alien hierarchy. We have identified certain strata of rank within the Wraith military, identifiable by the amount of armour it is permitted to wear.   ;Soldier: The Wraith solider class wears a segmented, armoured bodysuit with additonal plating at the shoulders and typically carries a plasma rifle. While this would seem a little underpowered, their ability to teleport into flanking positions and behind vehicles makes the need to carry heavier weapons unnecessary. ;Warrior: The Warrior class has considerably more variation in armament, with heavy plasma and plasma cannons being quite common. Apart from addtional plates on the legs, the primary difference is in the thickness and quality of the subdermal armour implants which considerably improve their resilience. ;Officer: Like other officers, the Wraith officer class is the only class to wear a helmet which covers the most vunerable part of their anatomy - the blue nodes. We don't really understand why more Wraith don't wear helmets to protect their node. While the nodes do produce a lot of heat, cooling shouldn’t be an issue for am empire who can apply superconductor to surfaces like paint.  ;Elite: Examination of the Elites’ armour suggests considerable “after market” modifications, the most common being a treatment similar to the hardening process we have observed in Landing Craft. We have also noted implants of an unknown type that improve the flexibility, agility and overall resilience of the Elite. Elites wear the most complete suits of armour - a green bodysuit similar in design to Sebillian Elites, as well as a more enclosing set of armour plating.    &lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;</Data></Cell>

I hope I shouldn’t have to warn you about their skill with sniper rifles, or their jump-packs.;Warrior: The most obvious upgrade the purple Warrior receives is the addition of armoured gloves and boots as well as upgrades to their targeting systems. Warriors have been seen carrying plasma cannon as well as plasma rifles, so watch out!;Officer: Officers are easily identifiable by both their red armour and the additional set of wings on their backpack. The Harridan Officer acts less as a commander and more as a co-ordinating node between different Harridans. Officers are the most intelligent of the Harridan race and are the most independently minded, so be wary when facing one.   ;Elite: The Elite is physically indistinguishable from other Harridans, however their black and grey suits are of the highest quality and incorporate powered elements that vastly improve their physical and mental capabilities. A near tactical match for Officers, the Elite is superior to other Harridans in every way.;Unusually, there is no evidence of higher-ranking leaders among the Harridans.

Any Andron is as capable in combat as it is piloting a UFO. Secondly, we have gathered data on two broad “classes” of Andron seen in the field.;Guard. We have dubbed the camo-green Andon &quot;guard&quot;-class due to their fairly predictable behaviour patterns and their protective attitude towards other aliens. It is is the most commonly reported model on the field. Generally equipped with a plasma rifle, but also seen with heavier weapons, this class of Andron is a terror to common soldiers and should be approached with care by any trooper only armed with a rifle.  ;Soldier. Larger, more imposing and better armoured than the guard-class, the navy blue solider class Andron exclusively carries heavy weapons, especially the heavy plasma gun.

As a general rule, the more dangerous an Andron is, the larger and bulkier it becomes, with the Elite class as the apex of power and physical size. ;Warrior: I hesitate to call any model of a mass-produced robot a “veteran”, but this description best fits. The light blue Warrior class is better armoured and equipped than the front-line solider class, and more importantly has superior logic and tactical analysis systems.   ;Elite: The GT model of Androns with all the optional extras. The massive Elite class sports a fancy red paint job while retaining the same basic form of the Warrior. Under the carapace a fascinating combination of sophisticated recoil dampers, gravitronic stabilisers and a powerful load-bearing frame turns the Elite into a bipedal micro-tank, capable of moving and shooting heavy weapons without a significant drop in accuracy or speed. ;Officer: This majestic purple monster possesses the same power as the Elite, but packs it into a sleeker frame. Officers are the most dangerous Andron you will face and that’s saying something, as they combine the raw power of Elites with a deep tactical intelligence.</Data></Cell>

I hate to turn those smiles into frowns (actually, I don’t) but those “hard targets” were, amusingly enough, not intended for ground operations. From our data we have strong reason to believe these are non-combatants. They form the operational core of any UFO crew, acting as pilots, engineers, navigators and other essential noncombat roles. They neither need nor are given more than basic training in combat, are armed with pistols and only have their naked (if resilient) skin as protection.

Sebillian veterans distinguish themselves from their lowly brethren by the quality of their armour and the ornate shoulder plates they wear. They are tougher, faster and stronger than anything you have faced previously. Standard armament for Warriors is the heavy plasma gun and the deadly plasma cannon. Watch out for Sebillians wearing a red gambeson under their armour plating.

I especially don’t appreciate those same research materials appearing as trophies in the man cave your soldiers call a barracks. The colouration of different Caesan jumpsuits has a clear sociological meaning that we have yet to penetrate, and it doesn’t help our cause when they are spirited away to be kept as knickknacks and good luck charms. Regardless of this setback, we have begun to distinguish between different colours and have the results below.;Guard. Blue-jumpsuited Caesans represent the first combat-ready Caesan we have met. Armed with plasma rifles, they can hold their own against a squad of ordinary soldiers. Their jumpsuits have several reinforced layers that can take considerably more punishment, although their physiology remains the same as non-combatants.  ;Soldier. The Guard, while fearsome, isn’t what we would consider a “front-line” trooper. That distinction is given to the  Soldier-class. Considerably more aggressive than the Guard-class, the Soldier carries a wider variety of armaments and isn’t afraid to fling grenades at any tightly-packed group of soldiers that get in its way. Its jumpsuit is marked by dark blue arms and light blue shoulderpads.</Data></Cell>

Even with the miracles of alien technlogy laid out in my lab  I would have never, ever credited that psychic phenomina existed except in the heads of the credlous and the cretinous. But in the face of evidence that I can reliably repeat, what else am I to call it? Psychics are real, Commander.   ;It's clear now why the Caesan brain is supersaturated with Alenium nanoparticles. These particles react with their unique brain structure in a manner we don't yet understand to power abilities that you or I would recognise as psychic. But while it seems that all Caesans have the potential for psychic powers, only a select few actually express this ability. Given what we know about Caesans, psychic abilities are probably deliberately left out of the standard clone, reserved for an elite few. We have termed these Caesans “Psions”, and they are recogniseable by the lurid purple jumpsuits they wear.  ;Thankfully, psychic “gifts” seem entirely related to various “modes” of telepathy. Thourough testing of a Psion shows that it could manipulate gross emotions (especially the sense of fear) and implant hallcinatory images (it was at that point I had to personally terminate the beast). You need not fear that a Psion will telekinetically lift a car and throw it at one of the men! However, I suggest advising squad leaders to make any Caesan in a puple jumpsuit a priority target. Their powers are subtle, and are all the more dangerous for being so.</Data></Cell>

The Enforcer is humanities first weapon designed specifically according to the newly obtained data and not just the old second-hand research we had from the Icelandic incident.&#10;&#10;Although, I will be earnest, Commander. We are still in a stage where producing effective weapons based on alien technology is far beyond our means. The Enforcer is more of an adaptation of our regular firearm than an invention of its own. But it is an adaption driven by the knowledge of what makes our enemies blead. Or at least the presumed knowledge.&#10;&#10;The logic behind our reasoning was that the aliens are equipped with weapons which were originally desinged to kill their own kind... and that does seem to be the case in our simulations using alien corpses (sadly enough human flesh seems to be equally affected). Therefore in order to penetrate their defenses we must imitate the characteristics, if not the technology, of their weaponry.&#10;&#10;The mainframe of The Enforcer is a Heckler &amp; Koch M5. We have, however, adjusted the barrel and equipped the magazines with explosive .45 rounds. This produces a hail of bullets which explode on impact. Effectively copying the effect of a single, low energy, plasma beam.&#10;&#10;Commander, I do not even want to concern my mind with what should be the work of petty clerks, but it does seem a good idea to start producing The Enforcer on a mass scale and selling it back to our funding partners. An anti-alien weapon certified by my team should make a nice profit. It is pitiful enough that we have to work on a limited budget, let us try to squeeze out extra funds by whatever means possible.</Data></Cell>

Amongst other things, this analysis suggests that the alien craft may possess one or more weak-points in their outer hulls which our operatives might exploit during tactical missions using specially designed explosive charges.  By breaching the hull of the alien craft, our operatives will be afforded superior access to the vessel and therefore be better placed to overpower any extraterrestrial defenders.&#10;&#10;The breaching charge we have designed for this purpose is simple to use.  The charge uses electromagnetic clamps to descure itself to the hull of the alien craft.  Once deployed, an operative need only set the detonator and retreat a few paces to ensure they are not caught in the blowback.  The device is highly precise and the collateral damage it causes is minimal.  This should avoid the unnecessary destruction of alien artefacts and allow operatives to deploy close to the intended breach site.&#10;&#10;[To use the breaching charge, place it in an operative's hands and arm it as with C4.  The Breaching Charge should then be dropped next to the intended target of the charge, and the operative retreated at least two squares away from the location it is deployed.]</Data></Cell>

It is getting quite cramped with all the alien artifacts being shipped. Additional working space would always be welcome. &#10;&#10;Of course, I do not requests such generosity whilst approaching you empty-handed. I would like to present to you the latest fruit of our hard labor. The LMG MK-ZP802 Zephyr.&#10;&#10;Unlike The Enforcer, Zephyr is not a modified version of any commonly available firearm but a completely new design made in collaboration with all of the world's most esteemed arms manufactures. We have received books-worth of blueprints and patents and as you might have noticed experts from NATO and the Warsaw Pact were recently invited to our laboratories to help with the project. At times it's difficult to remember that the Cold War is truly over.&#10;&#10;You do imagine the embarrassment I had to endure? Trying to organize everything in our cramped compartments and our dwarfed underground laboratories. Hardly anything that could be called a decent working environment. I am certain that additional funds allotted to the research division would significantly benefit the number of guests we can harbor and innovations we can produce.&#10;&#10;Amidst the harsh working conditions we did, however, produce a light machine gun which is as reliable as a Kalashnikov, as accurate as a FN FAL and its penetration capabilities are much more than you would expect from a weapon of this size.&#10;&#10;The drawback is the recoil produced. Now I have read the combat reports, and it seems that you soldiers, although being drawn from the world’s elite, are behaving subpar in face of the terror of an alien invasion. This might be a biological reaction which I think will be overcome through xeno-combat experience. But until your soldiers get some of that experience and regain their potential strengths and capabilities, I do advise you to issue Zephyr only to your more experienced soldiers. The trembling hands of a rookie will be better suited to something from our more traditional arsenal.&#10;</Data></Cell>

Admittedly, it is a  &#10;tempting idea but, I’m afraid, that would make our helos even more of a priority  &#10;target. As if the invaders weren't keen enough on shooting them down already.  &#10;Moreover, helos are an extremely easy target and would not be able to extended  &#10;plasma fire. I'm sure the pilots would instead prefer to maintain a low profile  &#10;and leave things as they are.&#10;&#10;Instead I propose we start manufacturing the HMG Korhang KR-R331 Heavy Machinegun.  &#10;In many ways, this is but a simple, scaled down Vulcan and its main role is to cut  &#10;down our enemies with as much bullets as able and as fast as possible.&#10;&#10;Many manufactures actually tried to design an infantry weapon of the sorts, a long  &#10;time before the invasion even started. But to scale down something as monstrous as  &#10;a 112 kg Vulcan and to keep it viable in battle was just impossible with the technology and materials they had to work with. That is not the case anymore. Our studies on cooling systems obtained from extraterrestrial drones have proven to be a great asset.&#10;&#10;Korhang is a great tool of destruction, suited for removing obstacles and harassing enemies. Suppression, comes to mind when thinking of Korhang and that is surely what you will get, as long as your soldiers are strong enough to use it. Please remember that the bullets were not designed to penetrate heavy armor. &#10;As with most of our newly designed weapons Korhang still weights much more than would be desired and the recoil is dreadful. You will always want to have another soldier covering the Korhang user as the weapon has, perhaps, the most complicated reloading system of our entire arsenal. Korhang has its place in between our standard heavy machinegun and our rocket launchers although it does not directly replace them.&#10;One more thing, Commander. It’s obvious to us at this point that we will soon be employing more and more energy weapons in our arsenal. Please do remember that some of our enemies poses a natural (or should I say: a genetically modified) resistance to energy damage.  Therefore a weapon such as Korhang might be still useful to us in the long run... and if not… I am sure that it does look intimidating enough to give us a good price at the international arms market.&#10;&#10;</Data></Cell>

I am more inclined to say that there will be no further wars if we lose the one we are fighting now. At least non concerning humans. &#10;&#10;Fortunately, having more knowledge than Einstein (and let’s not be modest: more intellect), I am at the position to say what weapons ARE used in War World III, as we might call our current encounter with the alien invaders.&#10;&#10;Namely, you will want to use the Warhawk WR-H33. It is a heavy pistol designed to bypass light and medium armor. It is a powerful weapon in close quarters combat and can also be used at medium range. That is, if you pose a designated marksman with enough aiming skills; or if you attach the handy laser sights (No, the laser sights are not the breakthrough in laser weaponry, which I was discussing with you earlier).  &#10;&#10;As you would imagine, a handgun like this will produce significant recoil. I advise to distribute it only amongst your strongest xenonauts. As it goes for the dual version, I have added a special mechanism that somewhat reduces recoil, at the cost of removing laser sights. Of course, using two Warhawks at a time is still more difficult than handling just one, but hopefully, not as much more difficult as you could expect.&#10;</Data></Cell>

You know, the concept of those pre-war activists. Oh, I know this is no time to be discussing environmental issues, but recycling did give me a rather extraordinary idea.&#10;&#10;The SPECIAL OPS - ThunderBolt AZT300 is produced from the plating of enemy crafts. The only material that can withstand the ammunition used in this hybrid-tech shotgun. Mind you, I am not speaking about alien alloys, but the much weaker plating layers which we now store in plentiful supplies. As for the ammunition we use the by-products of alenium (mostly the same as in our alenium explosives). The micro-particles extracted from alenium serve as makeshift gunpowder. Once the trigger is pulled chemical reactions inside the shotgun emit a controlled explosion and the lead bullets are shattered and set into motion at a disturbingly high velocity. In result we are producing not only a hail of lead and alenium shrapnel but we also emit a shockwave that can knock an enemy down.&#10;&#10;The shrapnel travels at a velocity high enough to easily penetrate medium armor, but the damage is, of course, limited due to the nature of shrapnel munitions being heavily inaccurate. &#10;&#10;The most obvious drawback is the clip size. We did consider making the magazine larger, but then again, alenium powered bullets are not safe enough to be cramped together. Apart from that using alenium as gunpowder requires a reasonable amount of cooldown, even with the new coolants we have recently procured from the invaders.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, I do see the ThunderBolt as a very dangerous weapon and I do hope you will encourage your men to use it. If the assets of this shotgun do not appease you, then please have in mind us scientists. Commander, we need live specimen. And we believe the ThunderBolt can provide those. Even if they are missing a limb or two.&#10;&#10;</Data></Cell>

I want to make that last resort count and bring our glorious men one step closer to victory. At least that's what you would like to hear from me, isn't it? The truth is, your men have been pestering me about the laser pistol since the day we developed it. They have been complaining about the battery's capacity. Ignorant fools. Isn't it obvious that a alenium conductor and optical amplifiers small enough to fit in a pistol won't be as efficient as the ones used in rifles? Instead they argued, that if they use the same battery for rifles and pistols, then why do they get more shots from the more powerful rifle. Non-scientific reasoning. Why do I even take my meals in the same cafeteria as your mis-educated soldiers?&#10;&#10;Fortunately for them, at times, science does also work the other way around. By working on advanced laser technology for our aircrafts we have opened up some unexpected paths leading to miniaturization of the mentioned optic devices. As for the conductor. It occurred to us that a few drops of Ceasan blood mixed with alenium do work wonders. I expect you do happen to encounter great numbers of Ceasan involuntary blood donors on a daily basis? Well even if you didn't, a few drops is what we need and I have already ordered a couple of gallons from my personal stores to be shifted to the factories. I do hope those oafs won't mistake it with the plum juice that's being distributed today.&#10;&#10;Parango - the result of our work is a state of the art laser pistol which is twice as efficient in terms of battery consumption compared to our previous design. The beams themselves inflict the same damage as before, however the laser is much more bright which could help us in blinding the enemy and therefore making him easier to stun. Additionally, the built in burst mode should give your soldiers the needed advantage when aiming is not an option.&#10;&#10;Admittedly, Parango is a bit heavier and produces some recoil due to aleniums instable nature, but it is still a very user-friendly weapon. I might consider making it mine weapon of choice, after all xenolaboratories aren't always the safest work environment.&#10;</Data></Cell>

I must advise you that the designated sniper will have to poses significant strength to handle it. Although the stabilizing mechanism is a masterpiece and the weapon produces literally no tangible recoil, its pure weight might pose a problem for the more feeble men or be that women.&#10;Additionally the soldier must have superb reflexes and intuition. The beam starts charging when the trigger is pulled and is released when pressed again. The time brackets in which the beam needs to be released are between 2.8 and 4.1. seconds.

No reason to be alarmed, although the lab is going to need a new practice range. I’m afraid that the new rocket launcher we developed brings out the worst instincts in our staff members. I admit, it might have been reckless to allow the testing to be done underground. Even if we are using low-explosive rounds.&#10;&#10;The Heavy Advanced Rocket Launcher or RPG Rage model YT-63 was designed to turn our power armored units into miniaturized rapid-fire tanks and as with Sulfur I urge you not to &quot;drive&quot; our little tanks into civilian buildings.&#10;&#10;Now if you could call those baboons from manufacturing to take away that horidly noisy prototype from my laboratory I would be most pleased.</Data></Cell>

Heavy explosives used in tactical missions result in far fewer alien specimen on our lab tables. A fact, that I am sure, you perfectly understand by now. I am afraid the same thing cannot be said about some of our more trigger-happy field operatives. However, going through latest battle reports I do understand that our situation is becoming more and more desperate and our troops are going to need effective means of defending themselves... or, may that be, defending our entire civilization.&#10;&#10;I do believe that the newly developed Tactical Rocket Launcher (codename: Sulfur) will greatly enhance our means of survival. Sulfur is designed to obliterate a given area of impact by sending out not one but three missiles at once. The codename was proposed by some of our more skeptical lab colleagues who argued that the weapon would result in no new artifacts to be salvaged and the only things left would be ash and the bitter aftertaste of barbaric destruction. I am sure your soldiers will love the smell. Speaking of soldiers, I do advise you to permit usage of Sulfur only to your most experienced and bulky xenonauts. The weapon requires a substantial amount of strength to handle; above average marksmanship is also required as we do not want stray missiles scattered all around the battlefield. &#10;&#10;When fighting more armored and resilient aliens Sulfur can provide excellent suppression fire. It can also be used as a kind of portable ram. Well if you consider having a ram that removes the door along with a huge part of the wall...or the whole building. I therefore strongly advise you against the use of Sulfur in urban areas - where civilians might be present.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s126"><Data ss:Type="String">Commander, we need to achieve air supremacy whilst the enemy crafts are still in the process of adjusting their machines to our atmosphere. Unfortunately, enemy scouts have already started destroying friendly military airports. Naturally, there are still a lot of camouflaged airport bases, but our organization has agreed (That is: we were forced to agree) not to use them, as we do not want to draw alien retaliation upon unprepared local forces.&#10;In this situation we will need to establish our own bases across the planet, but this will take some time and will require a substantial amount of resources. As a provisional solution we’ve decided to introduce a new aircraft into our fleet.&#10;&#10;I did feel that we still lacked a machine that would be able to take part in long range missions, whilst still being able to take the role of a dogfighter. Apart from that, the world is a big place and a lot of conventional nation-based radar stations have already been destroyed by the invaders... therefore a reconnaissance aircraft would also greatly contribute in the field of duty.&#10;&#10;Putting things bluntly: a multirole combat aircraft. And that is exactly what M2x Apollo is. A multirole combat aircraft capable of scouting, training, supporting crafts and bases (even at extreme distances) and if need be: engaging and shooting down the enemy. &#10;&#10;Apollo is a glimpse of what can be achieved when the world comes together. The airframe was taken directly from the French Mirage 2000, but the avionics were upgraded by NATO specialist, whilst the Soviets disclosed all their top secret files on maneuverability advancements. But most importantly, we have managed to fine tune the engine and achieve breathtaking results. A chore that technicians from no single country could have accomplished on such a tight schedule. Admittedly, this could not have been done without a supreme supervisor. Namely myself.&#10;&#10;But back to the point commander. M2x aircrafts will be now manufactured all over the world, and shipped to us when needed, though we will always need to make some of our own adjustments, the labor process should be relatively short. &#10;&#10;Apollos can be used in all roles, however, at the same time, you should be very cautious on which missions and when you decide to use them. There is always a high chance that an Apollo will not make it back, even missions which might be considered milk runs for Condors might pose a threat to Apollos. The main reason being - it is a light aircraft. We use virtually no armor plating, much less any anti-plasma platting. Furthermore it is a long-ranged aircraft, which means the pilot is surrounded mostly by fuel rather than metal. This means that every plasma impact is potentially lethal. My exact calculations? I would say that Apollo will be, on average, able to withstand 2, maybe 3 indirect hits. Enemy missiles? You mean those devastating, condensed plasma bolts that our Condor pilots are now so good at evading? Please give me a second to make my calculations... yes, yes. I estimate a finite number between null and zero. I'm sorry, Commander, but this must be said bluntly: you need to be extraordinary careful whilst deploying Apollo aircrafts. The life of our pilots lies in your hands.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, Apollo is able of making evasive maneuvers. Unfortunately, the turn rate is rather low. Very low. Be wary, getting the better of our enemies position won't be easy and prolonged dogfights are dangerous. You can counter this by commanding the pilot to slow the engine down and then making a turn, but be wary. M2x achieves substandard results in means of acceleration. Reaching full velocity might not happen as fast as the pilot would want, but on the other hand, the maximum velocity of Apollo is far beyond anything that our crafts OR the alien ones could achieve, at least to this day. &#10;&#10;&#10;Tactical briefing:&#10;- Extreme velocity and range there can be used as a support aircraft, bringing down damaged and escaping crafts.&#10;- Long radar range and high fuel levels - excellent map coverage.&#10;- Due to its speed and thus escape capabilities it can serve the role of a lightweight missile carrier.&#10;- Low acceleration and turn rate.&#10;- Very fragile - do not get in the range of enemy plasma blasters!&#10;- Be cautios when engaging fighter-class UFOs.</Data></Cell>

The aliens seem to adapt their technology towards anti-human weapons. This would mean that they certainly haven’t come here for a short visit. If they are determined to adapt, it means they are determined to stay. To take our planet away from us.&#10;&#10;The weapon subdues humans by putting them in delirious states. The chemicals used seem to work like a drug, though…how should I put this…not in a strictly biological ways. The brain does not receive any narcotics, the production of hormones is unaffected. It is as though the human mind is collapsing from within. In ways we do not even comprehend. &#10;&#10;The volunteers seem to be recovering by now and I think we can release them from quarantine soon enough. The chemical seems to be only a means of incapacitating a human opponent. They are not directly involved in the process of changing people into Gargols.

It is a device for capturing humans alive, though at times, being hit may also result in death. This is caused by the incapacitating, chaotic substance used in these weapons - vortex. &#10;&#10;The substance is of purplish color and that seems to be the only characteristic that does not change through applying pressure, temperature, velocity, energy or simply the factor of time. In every other way the behavior of this substance remains unpredictable and chaotic. It changes, seemingly random, between states of liquid, gas and solid body. I'm afraid we are in no way able to reproduce the results in a scientific manner. Worst of, all it does not just simply randomly change its molecular bindings, it does also, at times transcend into radiation. Atoms are transformed into waves and then again form back into atoms. I do not want to bore you, Commander, with the list of physical laws this overrules, but on the practical side, you might consider how devastating this might be on the battlefield. Imagine a bullet leaving the barrel whilst seeming weightless, and then, right before reaching the target, turning into the equivalent of solid steel. Or even worse: bypassing our armor as radiation and then turning solid beneath the flesh. Fortunately, the amount of vortex used with the Light Vortex Launcher is minimal (hence the LIGHT Vortex Launcher) and thus it will only mildly puncture our soldiers insides (needle sized internal wounds may occur). It will also dissolve after a while so in most cases advanced surgery will not be needed. However, if, for example, the heart is punctured...&#10;&#10;It would be useful to study different kinds of vortex powered weapons. We might then be able to better understand vortex itself.&#10;&#10;One more thing, Commander. I cannot say this will be a strict rule in combat, but it does seem to me that the weapon was designed for Sebillians and Ceasans. The grip seems to indicate that much, and so far this is being conformed in our combat reports. </Data></Cell>

But, as with alenium our brave minds have yet again, in a way, succeeded. This is our nature, Commander. The nature of adapting and retaliating. When saber-tooth cats attacked our ancestors, we retaliated by carving saber-tooth knives. When thick-hided herds of animals trampled our berry bushes, we took their skins, and turned them into our food, their furs,  into our armor. When lightning struck down our shelters, we harnessed its by-product: fire. And we set the world ablaze. We are going to set the world ablaze once again, Commander. And in due time, we will set THEIR world ablaze. Mark my words! &#10;&#10;Vortex is the key of bringing my words into motion.

Whilst Condors are ideal for shooting down light crafts, we still need a heavy fighter that will provide us with more options in case the invaders manage to bring some of their bigger crafts into our airspace. &#10;&#10;The Soviets were on a good way to creating a heavy interceptor which would be able to combat any NATO aircrafts: F15s among others. Ironically, the Soviet prototype: T10. Will now be equipped with many of F15s systems. All for a greater good. The T10 suffered from various defects, I’m sure the Russians would be able to pan those out themselves in a couple of years. But we no longer have those years (neither will we be fighting NATO’s air force). Instead we rushed the development project and a T-10 – F15 hybrid emerged. The Russians dubbed it Su-27; code: Red Eagle. But we will use our own terminology to avoid confusion with local military forces. And of course: our crafts will be enhanced with the latest anti-alien technology - to improve performance. &#10;&#10;Our Su-T10 will serve as a heavy fighter and will therefore be used to combat more sturdy alien crafts. Su-T10 can mount many more rockets than our Concords, and the damage output will naturally be much higher. The airframe was covered with twice as much titanium which should provide increased durability. Unfortunately, this did force us to reduce the weight of the electronic locking-system. Aiming and picking out targets will be left to the pilot.&#10;&#10;The codename: “Cheburashka” comes from one of our pilot’s first experiences with the T-10 prototype. The aircraft allows for extreme maneuvers both at low and high speed. Naturally, this will cause nausea to some of our less trained pilots. The mentioned pilot was shaky on his feet hours after the flight. It reminded the Soviet instructors of a Russian cartoon featuring a shaky, toppling creature – the Cheburashka.&#10;&#10;What might, cause nausea to you, Commander, is the price we will have to pay for each aircraft. The drawback of using rushed prototypes is of course the lack of mass-produced parts. Also, as might have been expected the amount of titanium on the market has radically diminished over the past months and therefore the upkeep cost of our Su-T10 will be high as well.&#10;&#10;Tactical briefing:&#10;&#10;- Heavy fighter suited for fighting small and medium crafts.&#10;- Concords are still a better choice against light scouts and fighters.&#10;- Very good maneuverability.&#10;- Very high potential damage output (at the cost of limited initial damage).&#10;- High cost and upkeep. &#10;</Data></Cell>

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s99"><Data ss:Type="String">We have conducted preliminary experiments on the substance used in this new alien weapon. Battle reports indicate that, with luck, the weapon only subdues the victim, rather than outright killing him. We do not yet know how this is done, however it was discovered (as in most cases: accidentally) that morphine instead of easing any pain the patient might suffer, actually removes the subduing factor.&#10;&#10;What this means, Commander. Is that you will be able to put your stunned soldier back on their feet, even during battle. All you need is a medic kit and a soldier who’s bright enough to operate a syringe.&#10;&#10;Though, I wouldn't advise sending morphine dosed soldier to the front line. In the best case scenario they will be knocked-out back to sleep. In the worst... I expect you already know your soldiers limitations better than I do.&#10;</Data></Cell>
